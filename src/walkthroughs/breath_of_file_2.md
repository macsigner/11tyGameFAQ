## Introduction
### Preface

This guide was created while playing the Super Nintendo Entertainment System
(SNES) version of BREATH OF FIRE II in 2001 and the walkthrough was completed
in 2002.  Since then, it has been updated continually ranging from the most
miniscule of updates, such as fixing spelling errors, to the most substantial,
such as adding an item that was not listed before!  (A travesty to the
perfectionist!)

It is with sadness that I inform you that this is the final version of this
guide.  Any mistakes will just have to suffice unfortunately.  I can no
longer devote any energy to maintain and update this guide.  I have removed
my e-mail address so let me address any possible reasons for wanting to
contact me.  These were the only three type of e-mails I ever received
over the past eight years, if I recall right.

1. Any errors will have to be tolerated as I no longer plan on updating
   the guide.  I apologize in advance.  If you're unsure about something, just
   go with your gut feeling over what's written in this guide.
2. You may host this guide on your website.  But please do not modify its
   contents.
3. If all you wanted to do was say "thank you" (rare!), just know that I
   appreciate your words and just say them out loud.  An omnipotent force will
   carry your words to me and let me know in some way or another! :)

### Story

Evil has begun surfacing itself in many forms:  Monsters are appearing in
abundance and the wind has begun blowing more fiercely from the bushes near
the village of Gate.  A religious movement has formed, sweeping towns left and
right with its teachings of a new hope that the people can cling to.  Something
is amiss, but no one can pinpoint just what's going on.

The story of BREATH OF FIRE II centers around a child named Ryu.  It is Ryu
and his friends who must travel across the world and discover the source of
this new evil.  Along the way, he will go through many a trial, and be tested
to the utmost.  But one question will linger unanswered for some time:  why has
Ryu been chosen to undertake this important quest?  The answer will be
revealed in due time.

### Controls

The controls for BREATH OF FIRE II are depicted with the help of the following
diagram of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Controller:

## Characters
### Overview

Each character is divided by the following three sections:

1. Biography
2. Characteristics
3. Natural Spells

#### Biography
Somewhat self explanatory, I hope.  This is merely a few remarks about the
character's personality and a little background information about them.

#### Characteristics

| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | Used on the field by pressing the Y BUTTON on the Controller. |
| Field Ability:   | Whether or not the character can hunt or fish or do neither. |
| Special Combat:  | The character's special command during combat |
| Learned Spells:  | The amount of natural spells the character learns. |

#### Natural Spells
The spells the character will learn as they raise their level, or has already
learned by the time that they join you.  Due to the way Breath of Fire 2's
algorithm for learning spells works, you may notice a slight deviation in the
actual LV listed here and the LV your character learns the spells by about 1 or
2 LVs.

For example, your Bow may end up learning the spell Cure 3 at LV 32 or LV 34
instead of what I noted for him:  LV 33.

### Ryu

#### Biography
Ryu is the protagonist of the story.  He, his father Ganer, and his sister Yua,
have been saddened by a family member's death.  He has the power of the dragon
inside of him, but to awaken those powers he must first recognize them.

#### Characteristics

| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | None |
| Field Ability:   | Fish |
| Special Combat:  | Guts ->  Recovers a part of Ryu's lost HP.  The less HP he has, the more it heals.  Has 1/8 chance to fail. |
| Learned Spells:  | 4 |

#### Natural Spells

| spell | level |
|---|---|
| TimeWarp:  | 2 |
| Cure 1:    | 7 |
| Cure 2:    | 16 |
| Smoke:     | 19 |

### Bow

#### Biography
Bow resembles an old-fashioned puppy, but more importantly, he has had a very
troubled childhood.  He will become best friends with Ryu, and like him, is a
fellow ranger.

#### Characteristics

| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | None |
| Field Ability:   | Hunt |
| Special Combat:  | Shot -> Has a chance to either deal a lethal blow to the monster.  If failing, it will inflict 1 HP damage. Some monsters are more susceptible to this attack than others. |
| Learned Spells:  | 11 |

#### Natural Spells

| spell | level |
|---|---|
| Cure 1:   | 2 |
| CurePsn:  | 3 |

| Cure 4:   | 30 |
| Cure 3:   | 33 |
| Renew X:  | 36 |
| Cure X:   | 40 |

### Rand

#### Biography

Rand is a strong ox with a kind heart.  He takes a little after his mother, who
will play a part of the story.  His extremely strong attacks combined with his
ability to cast many curative spells make him a very wise selection in your
party.

#### Characteristics
| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | Roll |
| Field Ability:   | None |
| Special Combat:  | Wake -> Attacks a party member for low damage.  Can wake from sleep status, and can resurrect a dead party member to 1 HP; doesn't work very often. |
| Learned Spells:  | 9 |

#### Natural Spells

| spell | level |
|---|---|
| Cure 1:   | Already Learned |
| CurePsn:  | Already Learned |
| Thunder:  | 9 |

| 8.0:      | 24 |
| Renew:    | 27 |
| Heal:     | 31 |
| Cure 3:   | 35 |
| Cure 4:   | 37 |

### Katt

#### Biography

Katt's fiery hair matches her personality--she is strong and fights for what
she believes in.  She is also quite friendly and will prove to be a valuable
asset to you in your journeys.  Her cat-like characteristics combined
with her human-like figure make her a very appealing person.

#### Characteristics
| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | Whack It (With My Stick!) |
| Field Ability:   | Hunt |
| Special Combat:  | Dare -> Katt uses her turn to provoke monsters into attacking her rather than the other characters in the party. Not really useful because of Katt's low HP and Defense. |
| Learned Spells:  | 3 |

#### Natural Spells

| spell | level |
|---|---|
| Fireball:  | 11 |
| Hail:      | 13 |
| Bolt X:    | 15 |
### Nina

#### Biography

While Nina may be a princess of Windia, she truly does not fit in with royalty.
She may not be strong physically, but her spells make her very useful in many
battles.  She has wings on her back, so she isn't an ordinary human.

#### Characteristics
| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | Fly (Over Holes In Dungeons) / Call Mina (Late In The Game) |
| Field Ability:   | None |
| Special Combat:  | Will -> Recovers AP.  The less AP she has, the more likely she is to recover AP, and the more AP she will end up getting. |
| Learned Spells:  | 20 |

### Sten

#### Biography

Sten has a mysterious past and won't talk about it to anyone.  He's moved on,
having left his hometown for personal reasons.  He isn't much of a fighter, but
his mix of decent attacks and decent spells makes him an all-around useful
party member.  His Reach power will prove to be very useful to you in certain
situations.  Make sure you have this cool monkey nearby in your party.

#### Characteristics
| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | Reach |
| Field Ability:   | None |
| Special Combat:  | Rip -> Sten plays dead, and won't be targetted by monsters. He still attacks that turn, but it seems to make no difference he inflicts.  If he is the lone survivor, he will still be targetted, and will take much more damage--not to be used when he's alone! |
| Learned Spells:  | 5 |

#### Natural Spells

| spell | level |
|---|---|
| Spark:     | Already Learned |
| Bomb:      | 10 |

| Missile:   | 38 |

### Jean

#### Biography

Jean has a very special connection to the royalty of his hometown of SimaFort.  
When you first meet him, you will be unaware of how he really looks like until
a little later on.  He knows French and isn't afraid to use it!

#### Characteristics
| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | Turns Into A Gigantic Frog |
| Field Ability:   | None |
| Special Combat:  | Jab -> Jean attacks all monsters on the field, but inflicts less damage. |

| Death:     | 32 |

### Spar

#### Biography

Spar is a being of nature and has many friends of the forest.  Before you can
recruit him into your party, you must first rescue him from the caged cell he
has been placed into.  His unique transformation abilities with shamans make
him quite a unique character to command.  His abundance of spells makes him
one of the most useful characters in the game.

#### Characteristics
| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | Walk Through Forests |
| Field Ability:   | None |
| Special Combat:  | Ntre -> Spar calls on the power of nature.  It works on all open fields, but not in underground, basement dungeons.  There are several attacks depending on the background of the battlefield.  It can go from a small healing to all characters, to a tree that attacks all monsters for huge damage, to a cactus exploding, to flowers blooming (defense down on monsters). |

### Bleu

#### Biography

The name "Bleu" should sound familiar to you!  She is quite ancient, but her
appearance is that of a young woman.  She appears to be a snake, but she can
live outside the water just fine.  There are a lot of mysterious things about
her, but one thing's for certain:  Bleu is the most powerful magician in the
world!  If you can only get her to join the party...

#### Characteristics
| property | description |
|---|---|
| Special Power:   | None |
| Field Ability:   | Hunt |
| Special Combat:  | Shed -> Bleu recovers all HP and status ailment, but her defense lowers (defense down status). Unlike Ryu's ability, it works all the time and recovers all HP. |

## Walkthrough

                                o------------o
                                | Directions |
                                o------------o

The walkthrough is separated by large blocks of segments called "scenarios."
These are unofficial; just think of these as chapters that divide the game into
a more manageable fashion for you and I to refer to.  I've numbered each area
beginning with the first area, Gate (1), all the way through to the end.  I
also listed what level my hero was when I entered the area, and who my party
consisted of.  Levels and parties are just preferences; you could very well end
up at the last stage of the game with completely different levels and an
entirely different party than what I had used.

I also listed what items were available in each area, and where each item
is located, so you can find it.  There will be times where you won't be able
to get certain items in places such as HomeTown until advancing further in
the game.  For example, you can't enter the church of HomeTown, which has
an Herb in one of its dressers, until after going through Mt.Fubi and some
other places.  I've taken up the task of putting up these places again
when it's a good time to back to that place and get the item(s).

Any item I list followed by a * means that it's a Special Item.  Special
Items are found under the "Spcls" menu in the Item's Command Screen, and
cannot be used normally.  Sometimes, they will disappear from the list after
their purpose is finished.

The main hero of Breath of Fire II's default name is "Ryu."  That's what I
will call him in the entire walkthrough.  If you named your hero a different
name, then you might not be able to fully enjoy the walkthrough--but I'm sure
you can manage!  :)

In essence, this walkthrough just shows you where items are in dungeons and the
like.  There are a few exceptions where I specifically mention items that you
can only get from fishing (the best weapon and armor for example) and how to
get those items.  For additional information on the specialized mini-games and
hunting/fishing, I suggest looking at in-depth guides (assuming they exist) for
those activities.  In particular, Ben Siron's guide is very, very good.

### Scenario 1 - The Destined Child
#### Start

Insert the BREATH OF FIRE II game pak into the Super Nintendo Entertainment
System and turn the system on.  Wait for the title screen to appear and press
the A or START BUTTONs to advance to the File Select Screen.

(Note:  If you wait for a brief period of time whilst on the title screen, the
game will loop a small clip of each of the main characters in action.)

Select "New Game" to start a new game and then select "No. 1 Nothing" to start
the first empty slot available and advance to the Character Name Screen.

Select a name, or to get the default name ("Ryu"), select "End" without
entering any characters in the Name Field Box.  This will take you to the
Options Screen.

Select an appropriate Message Speed, Sound, and Music choice.  Select "End" to
create a new file.

Finally, back at the File Select Screen, select "Game Start" and select "No. 1
Ryu 01" to begin the game.

|                                                                           |
| Herb:      Search the medicine cabinet on the 1st floor of the northern   |
|            house.                                                         |
o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

The game begins in a black and white scheme with "Ganer"--Ryu's father--
calling out Ryu's name and telling Ryu to come to him.  Do so, but first note
one of the reoccurring themes of Breath of Fire II:  searching the dressers
for items.  In Breath of Fire II, by searching dressers and medicine
cabinets, there are items for you to obtain.  So search the dresser in Ryu's
room for a TreePole and then go down the stairs to meet with Ganer.  He'll ask
Ryu if he'll go find "Yua"--Ryu's little sister.  If you select "No" Ganer will
punch Ryu's head, scold him further, and repeat his question.  In order to
advance the game, you need to select "Yes."  After doing so, exit the church.

Once you're outside the church, talk with one of the women standing in front
of the house in the center of the village who asks, "Isn't Yua always playing
at the back mountain?"

Keep heading north until finding a small patch of grass blocking your way
north.  Clear the grass by standing in front of it and by pressing the A
BUTTON on the Controller.  Continue up to enter a new area called "BushLnd."

Note:  If you are unable to clear the grass/bush in the north part of the
village, it means you haven't spoken with the woman who asks if Yua is always
playing at the back mountain.

                                       *

| 2.  BushLnd |

| Party:  Ryu  |
| Level:  1    |
| Items:  None |
o--------------o

The path that appears before you splits into three paths:  west, center, and
east.  The western and eastern paths eventually lead to dead-ends, so stay on
the center path and enter the opening.

Now everything should be in color.  Continue up a bit and you'll find Yua, but
suddenly, a monster comes and fights you.

#################
# Boss Battle 1 #
# Beak          #
#################

Keep attacking it until Ryu's health is low, then out of nowhere, Ganer comes
and kills the Beak off by throwing down a thunder bolt.

After the battle, Ganer will tell Yua and Ryu about their mother and the
"Dragon" that came to protect them from the "Monster."  Ganer then asks Ryu
that if he had more strength, things would have been different.  If you say
"Right!" Yua will disagree with Ryu and convince Ganer otherwise.  If you say
"Not true!" (the nicer answer to go with), Yua will reaffirm what Ryu said.

Afterwards, Yua and Ganer will leave, and the game will ask you if you'd like
to close your eyes.  If you select "Yes", the game will black out for a moment,
show the Eye from the prologue, and will return back to Ryu with the music
being silent.  If you select "No" nothing will change.  It doesn't matter what
you say in the long run.  After you decide, exit BushLnd and head back to
Gate...

                                       *

If you talk to the villagers, they will be asking Ryu who he is and where he
came from.  It seems something strange has just happened that you don't know
about (for now).

After talking to everyone, enter the church and talk to "Father Hulk."  He'll
assume you're an orphan and give you a bed to sleep on.  While you sleep, a
little, puppy-like character will wake you up and ask you if you're going to
stay at the church.  If you say "Yes" Bow will get somewhat irritated and
leave the room.  In order to advance the game you must go through the doorway.
Doing this will have him come back up the stairs and realize you changed your
mind.  If you say "No" Bow will be happy.  Whatever your decision, the end
result is the same and Bow will join the party (though, he's technically not
part of it if you observe the status screen).

Exit the church and exit Gate.  Now you'll be outside on the map.  Head west
and the rain will begin to pour down.  Continue west and enter the small
cave.  There will be no enemy encounters.

Bow will light the candle he stole from the church earlier so you can see.  
Follow the path and you'll discover a weird looking tail; follow it and
you'll discover it's a very big monster.  It'll whack Bow out of the way.
Ryu will have to fight it on his own.

# Boss Battle 2 #
# Barubary      #
#################

You are supposed to die in this fight because, as size shows, there is no way a
little kid could match up with a monster like the gigantic Barubary.  Try to
attack him, but you will only inflict around a measly 2 points of damage.  On
the other hand, he will inflict about 250 points of damage on you.

Once you pass out, Barubary will talk to you about the "Destined Child" and
"God" and then the game will finish the introduction.  This is the point in
the game where Breath of Fire II really begins.

o--------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Ten years have passed now.  You'll find out that Bow and Ryu are full-fledged
rangers, and the Elder of the town will offer them a job.  The job is to find
a pet pig called Suzy, but the only reason why Bow wants to do this job is
because he digs the owner of the pig, Mina.

Exit the guild and you'll be able to explore HomeTown--sort of.  Some people
who are standing in the way block off the northern part, but you'll be able to
get there later in the game.

For now, exit HomeTown and walk around town building up levels and coins.  
Try getting Ryu to at least LV 4 and then use your coins to buy some of the
equipment in town.

You may notice some grass and fishing spots that appear on the field after
returning from a battle.  The grass spot is useful because if you enter it
(by pressing the A BUTTON on the Controller), you'll enter a little hunting
range where you can hunt down animals for roasts and meats.  You can then
sell the roasts for 200 coins a pop, which is much quicker to get than by
fighting the enemies around town.  Make sure you put Bow in the lead of your
marching order, and then press the Y BUTTON on the Controller to have him
activate his special power to hunt the animals.

And here's another way to make money (this tip assumes you have obtained the
Treepole from the dresser in Gate as a child Ryu):  Buy as many Worm items
with the money you currently do have.  Then go outside town and keep fighting
until you see a fishing spot pop up.  Using the TreePole and the Worms you
bought, you can nab lots of fishes.  Since one Worm costs 4C and each fish
sells for 30C, you will be making a 26C profit on each fish.

Once you're fully prepared, enter the circus just south of HomeTown if you
like, or skip it and head south to reach "Mt.Fubi"

your 30 coins if you're actually serious about the game, though.

As you head north, you'll hear some hissing sounds; for now, just ignore them
and enter the little opening.  You'll now see a water fountain inside, which
you can drink from to cure yourself of all ailments and restore your HP.  Use
this to your advantage and build up levels; if you can get up to LV 6, you'll
have an easier time through.  Once you're done, continue north, and when you
exit the cave, you'll hear some more voices.

Now you're getting close to where you want to be.  Continue just a little bit
and you'll finally discover the source of all that noise.  You'll now fight
your true first boss fight in the game:

###################
# Boss Battle 3   #
# Palo Peach Puti #
###################

Have Ryu attack always.  Have Bow first cast Def-Up on Ryu, and then Cure 1
whenever his health is in danger.  The monsters will then begin to attack each
other, and that is when it will be easy for you to finish all three of them
off.  Keep in mind that the middle one (Palo) has 80 HP and Peach and Puti have
40 HP.  So a good strategy would be to finish off Peach and Puti first.  You
can also have Ryu defend and Bow attack to win this battle since Ryu will be
taking the hits, and having him defend will minimize their damage.

Once you're through with that battle, it might be a good idea to go back to
the water fountain and drink from the clear water to get Bow's AP full so he
can cure Ryu if needed because you still have a little ways to go.

Continue from where you beat Palo, Peach, and Puti, and then head west, then
north, to find a little cave opening blocked by a small boulder.  Move it
aside and it'll fall down, collapsing the other cave opening where the water
fountain was.  Enter the new opening.

This part is straightforward; when you come to a fork in the road that means
that one of the paths will be a dead end, but there's a chest.  Once you're
at the southern end, you'll find a spacious gap in which you must fall into.  
Now you'll find yourself in a small room, but with a man inside called Azusa.  
He doesn't play a part in the game yet so don't worry about what he says for
now.  Continue, and then finally exit Mt.Fubi.

When you get to the map, head a little ways to the west to come across some
ruins.

o------------------------------------------------------------o

Once you enter, you'll hear someone crying for help.  Go inside the broken up
building and you'll find a man surrounded by a herd of cockroaches.  You'll
have to battle them out, so be prepared for what could be a laughable fight.

#################
# Boss Battle 4 #
# Pest (x6)     #
#################

Just have Ryu attack them, and he'll knock off pests in one blow.  Have Bow
cast Cure 1 if needed.  The Pests have a small amount of HP, so no matter what
level you are you should be able to knock them each out in one blow.

Now you'll fight the real boss of it all--a huge roach:

#################
# Boss Battle 5 #
# Roach         #
#################

This insect fight is almost as easy as the other; have Ryu always attack.  Bow
should attack unless Ryu absolutely needs curing.  The Roach can regenerate
itself when you're about to kill it (its HP = 0), so be careful.

Now, Niro--the person you just saved--will thank you and ask you to eat with
him.  The problem, though, is that what he wants to eat is no less the object
of your journey:  Suzy.  Ryu and Bow will save Suzy from the burning fire and
Bow will put Suzy in his bag.  Bow will then ask Ryu to hurry up and get back
to HomeTown.  Now, you'll have to go back through Mt.Fubi in order to do
that.

Once you're in HomeTown, enter the guild and find the Elder.  Bow and Ryu
will hand Suzy over, and Mina will be happy--but not happy enough to give Bow
that kiss he wanted.  Anyhow, exit the guild and Bow will ask Ryu if he
wishes to rest.  Say yes and you'll sleep.  Saying no will not allow the game
to progress further until you go in Ryu and Bow's room to sleep at the second
floor of the house left of the inn.

While Ryu is sleeping, Bow will open the door and a man named "Kilgore" will
enter.  Kilgore wants Bow to take back a treasure someone stole from him.  
Bow agrees to the job, and decides not to wake Ryu.

Ryu awakens, but it's still nighttime in HomeTown.  Exit the house, head a
little north, and a woman will bump into you.  Continue north (remember, this
is the part of town you couldn't go to before) and talk to Kilgore.  He will
explain that he didn't mean for Bow to get into trouble.  Anyhow, after all of
this, go back to your room and you'll find Bow.  For Bow to appear in your
room, you must have talked to Kilgore.  Talk to Bow, and he'll ask you if you
think he stole anything.  Just say no--Ryu's his friend after all--and he'll
begin to explain everything.

After explaining, a soldier will knock on the door, and Bow will hide in the
trashcan.  The soldier will come inside and tell you that you can't hide Bow
(even though you just did).  When the soldier leaves, Bow will, technically
at this point, no longer be in your party, but he'll still follow you as a
trashcan.

Exit HomeTown and use the south exit.  When the gatekeeper asks you what you
are holding, it doesn't matter what you say even if you answer, "Bow," he'll
let you pass.  This is because the gatekeeper believes Bow is innocent.  Now,
before exiting HomeTown, make sure Ryu is equipped with the best possible
equipment from town because you'll now be fighting battles without Bow.  Head
back to the Ruins as Bow told you to.

Niro will welcome you, and Bow will ask if he can stay and hide with Niro.  
Niro only agrees if Bow will help him out with the repairs.  Bow will stay at
the Ruins and now your goal is to find out where this female thief went to
because the only way you'll ever be able to clear Bow's name is to find her.

From the Ruins head northwest, past the bridges, to the next town called
"Coursair."

Talk with everybody and you'll understand that Coursair is the home of the
one and only coliseum.  Head inside the pub and talk to one of the bar
tenders.  If it's day time, say yes when he asks you if you want to kill some
time until evening.

Once it's nighttime, talk to the muscular person in red clothing and he'll
tell you that all the tickets are sold out at the coliseum.  He then gives
you a clue that someone called "Baba" is the opponent at the coliseum.  Now
you'll have to find this "Baba" person.  He lives in TagWoods, which is a
little north of town.

Before even thinking about heading out there, make sure you equip Ryu with
the best possible equipment in town.  If you equipped yourself well in Home
Town, then the only thing you need to buy is a BronzeHT and RangerCL.  Also,
raise Ryu to at least LV 7.  The best place to gain EXP, for now, is at Tag
Woods.  Make sure you bring at least five Herbs as well.  It's considered
good practice to always keep a stash curing items in your inventory at all
times, so please get into this habit.

This place is confusing at first, so start by familiarizing yourself with it.  
Try gaining EXP and finding all the chests, but at the same time, try
remembering the fastest way to reach Baba, and then head back to town and
rest at the inn so you're fully prepared when you do face him.

From the start of the woods, go up until some trees block you.  Then go left
to find a little tree house, in which you can get up to by climbing the
ladder.  Then enter the house and you'll be taken by a bucket and ride north
a bit.  Now, head right, enter the next bucket, and ride further east.  From
the 2nd tree house, follow the southwest trail to find Baba.  Before talking to
him, make sure you have full HP.  Baba will be angry with you for wanting to
enter the fight in his name, so he'll fight you.

#################
# Boss Battle 6 #
# Baba          #
#################

Attack him until Ryu has about half his HP total left.  When Ryu's HP drops
that low, use an Herb or cast Cure 1.  One positive thing about this battle is
that Ryu will more than likely counter attack Baba whenever he attacks, so
you'll eventually defeat him faster than you would anticipate.  But the
negative aspect is that Baba can counter attack Ryu too, so be careful.

After defeating Baba, he'll give you his ax and his permission to enter the
coliseum in his name.  Leave TagWoods and you should know by now where
your next stop is:  the Coliseum (located inside the town of Coursair).

Before going to Coursair, you can try an optional detour, assuming you got
the Gold item in one of the chests in TagWoods.  Look for a fishing spot
south of Coursair with a Maniro that sells some advanced equipment that you
can find in a kingdom that's a bit far off, called SimaFort.  The equipment
is somewhat expensive though, so if you don't have a lot of coins you shouldn't
bother doing this.

Once you're in Coursair, if it's daytime, you will have to go to the pub and
kill some time until it's night so you can talk to the muscular person in red
clothing again.  He'll then realize that you're Baba (technically you're not,
but just go along with what he's saying) and be disappointed that a scrawny
looking kid like you could have such a reputation of being so powerful.

For fun, the game has decided to automatically rename you Baba.  Go ahead and
check the status screen out!  Anyway, go to the coliseum, and this time,
there shouldn't be anyone blocking your way inside.  Make sure you bring a
good amount of Herbs with you.

| 1000C:  In the left-side door, there is a treasure chest; open it.  But see |

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go to the room to the right like the soldiers tell you to and talk to the
receptionist.  She'll tell you that you need to be "interviewed."  Enter the
door and talk to the muscular-half-naked-person; he'll fight you.  This
battle is so easy, that there is no need to explain how to defeat him.  
Simply put auto mode on during combat, and you'll win easily.

Exit this room, and the receptionist will tell you that you have passed.  
Next, go into the room to the right to find the manager, Augus.  Augus will
want to stage this fight with you and this so-called female opponent.  She'll
decide to throw out some poisonous darts at her, and all you have to do is
not get hit by them.  Unfortunately, for Augus, you will not be following
those plans.

Augus mentions some sort of reward in your locker room, in which lies a chest
with a whopping 1000 coins.  Go to your locker room and open the chest, but
don't talk to the soldier.  Next, go to the bank in Coursair and deposit all
of your coins; you'll find out why later.

Go back to the Coliseum, now talk to the soldier, and then try opening the
door.  "Rand" (that muscular guy in red clothing) will come and talk with
you.  Ryu will explain everything to him and he'll ask you for all your
money.  Say yes, and he'll decide to buy two antidotes to save both you and
your female opponent from the poisonous darts.  This is why you should have
put your money in the bank; even if you have no coins left, Rand will still
be able to "buy" the antidotes.

Side note:  In case you were curious, there is another strategy that will
allow you to keep the 1000 coins:

1) Don't open the chest.
2) Talk to the soldier.
3) Give Rand all your money, and once he's gone, you can open the treasure
   chest.

Rand will go talk to the female opponent, but she'll refuse to believe him.  
Anyway, now you find out that the only way you'll protect her is by knocking
her out for her own good.  Enter the next two doorways and be prepared to
fight "Katt."

#################
# Boss Battle 7 #
# Katt          #
#################

This is the toughest battle you've faced so far.  Have Ryu use Herbs and cast
Cure 1 whenever his HP drops under 20.  Katt has a lot of HP, so be prepared to
spend a couple of minutes battling it out.

Now, during the dialogue, hold up on the CONTROL PAD so that you move Katt
away from the darts and into the doorway north of you.  This is very
important because you must save Katt if you want her to join your party now.
However, Katt still joins you later on in the game even if you don't save
her right now; the only difference is if you didn't save her from the darts
you will have to fight the next boss without her, after which she will join
you.

Once it's all said and done, Katt will apologize to Ryu, and join him.  Now
that Katt is in your party, you might as well buy her some equipment from the
armory because her wear is very weak when she joins you.

Now that you're prepared, go back to the Coliseum once again.  This time, go
to the manager's room and you'll find Rand with Augus.  Augus will turn into
a demon and challenge all three of you.

#################
# Boss Battle 8 #
# Augus         #
#################

Not only do you have Katt in your party, but you now have Rand too.  Have Ryu
and Katt always attack, and have Rand cast Cure 1 whenever someone needs  it.
Since Katt is awfully quick though, you may want to haver her use Herbs when
you need HP in a snap.  And be careful!  If Augus saves her strength and
attacks, she'll deal quite a lot of damage.  Try taking her out as quickly as
possible to prevent her from doing any serious damage.

Once the battle is finished, go to the inn and regain your strength.  Your next
stop is the Ruins.

Once you arrive, Bow will greet Ryu and everyone.  Finally, Rand and Katt
will realize that your real name is Ryu, and not Baba.  Bow will ask you if
Rand can stay and help him since he doesn't think Katt would do a good job
with the repairs--so that leaves you only with Katt.  Talk to Rand and he'll
talk about a "Magic School."  The Magic School is located in one of the
buildings in HomeTown, so that's your next destination.

As you head north, you'll hear an explosion and witness some magic power by a
woman with wings.  It appears that three men wanted to take her away to their
boss but she scared them off.  Katt will ask you if she can learn some magic;
if you say no, she'll continue to ask you again, so just say yes and then go
inside the school.

Talk with everyone and you'll learn about someone named "Nina" and the "Joker
Party."

Go up to the 2nd floor and enter the room to the right.  You'll eavesdrop
into what Nina--the girl with the flying wings you saw earlier--and a person
named "Yoji" are talking about.  Then, suddenly, a "Hood" will come and
blackmail Nina into coming with them because they now have taken Nina's
little sister, Mina hostage.  The name Mina should sound familiar; she's the
owner of the pet pig you had to find.  Katt will ask Ryu to rescue the two
sisters.

Next stop:  Mt.Rocko.  Mt.Rocko can be found south, and then west, of
Coursair.  It's a cave surrounded by mountains.  Make sure you have a good
supply of Herbs and Antdts beforehand.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Once inside, talk to the Hood, and you'll have to fight him.  It should be an
easy battle.  I suggest you go into the northern middle room of the 1st floor,
and fight the monsters in there until Katt is at least at LV 8.  Most of this
floor doesn't seem to have monsters occupying it.  The Hoods here will give
you clues about their boss's family.  There is no need for you to write down
what they say, so just continue.

Go into the northeastern opening and talk to the Hood in front of the gate.  
He'll ask you what the boss's nephew's name is.  The game will now give you
six choices, but only one is right.  The correct choice is "Pain."  If you
give him the right name, you won't have to battle with him, but if you give
him the wrong name, you'll fight him, and then you'll have to push the switch
yourself to open the gate.  That's the only difference, so it doesn't
essentially matter in the end what you say.

After answering, the gate should be opened and you should be able to
continue.  The next guard will ask you if the switch for the next gate is in
the hole.  You'll have to check and see, but before you do, make sure your HP
is full.  You'll find out that it was a trap, and you'll fight both, the
Hood, and a P.Spider.  Ryu or Katt will also take about 10 points of damage
and become poisoned depending on who is in the lead of the marching order.

#################
# Boss Battle 9 #
# P.Spider Hood #
#################

Defeat the Hood first since he has the lowest amount of HP and might become an
annoyance if you allow him to stay alive.  The P.Spider is easy to defeat if
you have Ryu always attack it.  Have Katt use Herbs and Antdts on herself and
Ryu to ensure that everyone is stable during the fight.

It might be a good idea to go back to an inn and regain your strength after
this fight, and then come back.  Anyhow, continue by going down the stairs.  
The rest of this area is straightforward.

Once you get to the Hood standing by, talk to him, and you'll have to defeat
him.  Now you'll find out that Joker wants to make Nina his slave.  Go ahead,
and Katt will tell you she'll take care of this.  Now you'll have to fight
four Hoods, though they should be easy to take care of.  After the fight,
Joker will turn into a demon and you'll have to fight him, but this time you
have Nina on your side.

##################
# Boss Battle 10 #
# Joker          #
##################

Have Ryu and Katt attack him, while Nina casts Cold.  The other three magic
spells she has won't do as much damage on Joker.  If anyone's HP is low, have
Katt use Herbs since she's the fastest person.  This battle is unbelievably
easy so long as you conform to a balanced strategy.

Once you defeat Joker, Nina will thank you and join your party.  Now you'll
have to exit Mt.Rocko and head to "Windia."  Windia is located west of Tag
Woods, but you'll have to go through the "Dead Maze" first.  On your way
there, it would be a good idea to go to Coursair and equip Nina with better
equipment.

Talk to the soldier behind the gate and he will let you pass.  Now you'll be
in some sort of maze that's somewhat complicated.  Just keep heading west,
and then south, to find a set of stairs going up.

o----------------------------------------------------------------o

Once you're out of the maze, you'll be inside a castle.  The queen appears to
ignore Nina as her daughter, and orders all of you, except Mina, to leave.  
She does seem to recognize Mina as her daughter, though, thus Mina decides to
stay at the castle.

You'll now be in the village of Windia.  Katt will be surprised about what
just happened, and tells Nina she likes her wings, even if they are black.

Continue south, and a monkey will start a magic show.  He'll pressure Ryu
into doing a disappearing act trick.  Ryu follows the act, disappears, and
Nina and Katt pester the monkey to make Ryu come back.  The monkey then
flirts with Katt and Nina, and asks both of them out for a date.  Finally,
Ryu comes out of the ground.  "Sten," the monkey, will be surprised you
forgave him for his little nuisance, and he'll happily ask you if he can join
your party.  You now have four members in your party for the first time in
the game.

Some of the people in town know of the thief that you're looking for and
tell you that she went somewhere west.  Your next goal is to go to a town
called "Capitan," which is located west of Windia.  Before you get there,
though, you'll notice the monsters are quite strong around Windia.  It would
be a good idea to build everyone to a base of LV 10 before attempting to go
to Capitan.  You should also gain a lot of coins to buy all that expensive
equipment at the Windia armory as well.  It's a good idea if you make sure
everyone has the best possible equipment before the trip, and have a good
supply of Herbs and, especially, Antdts, since the "Deathpedes" can poison
all four of your characters in one round of battle.

Along the way to Capitan, feel free to go ahead and enter the circus near
Windia.

the Circus near HomeTown.

Continuing on the way to Capitan, you'll notice a lodge all by itself (it's
just a little west of Windia).  Enter it.

Talk with all the boys, and they'll tell you about "Uparupas" and monster
hunters.  At this point in the game, there isn't much to do here except search
the dresser to find a HelpBL.  Don't bother going north of the lodge, which
will lead you to Owl Woods, because you can't do anything there (yet).  For
now, continue to head west to find the town of Capitan.

Once you reach Capitan, don't go inside the well just yet.  First, rest up at
the inn, save your game at the dragon shrine, and then talk with everyone.  
You'll learn that some villagers are stuck inside the well.  Make sure you
have a steady supply of Herbs, or even HelpBLs, and enter the well when

You'll drop inside the well, and you'll find a person named "Ray," who will
tell you about the whole dilemma.  Then, suddenly, a monster comes out of
nowhere and you'll have to fight it off.  "Creon" should be pathetically easy
for your party to handle.

After the battle, Ray will ask you if you'll help save the children inside
the well.  Saying no will only affect your dragon meter, so just say yes to
make the game progress.

In the next room, Ray will be busy fighting a monster so you'll have to save
the villagers on your own.  Head north into the next room, and you'll be in a
room with turtles swimming in a pond.  The point of this is to ride the
turtles to the pieces of land (you can get the treasure chests this way).  Make
sure you get the Van.Ext, because it can restore a whopping 120 HP for all of
your party members in one dose!

The man standing nearby will tell you that his son needs your help in order
to save him.  Before getting to the boy, make sure your characters' HP is
full because you're about to fight a boss now.  Once you're ready, ride the
turtle to the boy and then talk to him.  Suddenly, a large creature appears.

##################
# Boss Battle 11 #
# Terapin        #
##################

Terapin can do an attack called FireBrth that can knock off anywhere from 30 to
50 points of damage to everyone.  It can also do an attack called Brain Way,
which can control one of your party members to attack another, but the effects
only last for one round.  Have Ryu attack always, Katt should attack, but use
Herbs constantly whenever anyone needs it.  Have Sten cast Bomb or use Herbs,
and Nina should cast Tornado or use Herbs.  Remember to use the Van.Ext you
picked up whenever your party's HP is low.  This fight proves to be rather
difficult even if you're at LV 12.  If all else fails, try putting everyone in
the defense position and set everyone to "Auto."  In time, the Terapin should
go down using this strategy, though you may have a few of your characters die.

Once you defeat Terapin, everything will start shaking.  Ride the turtles
back into the previous room, and Ray will tell you it feels like the
vibration is making the damn overflow.  Then all of a sudden, a wave of water
will come splashing towards you.  Ray will put up a shield to block it for
the time being.  He'll ask you to save the villagers now.  Do not say yes to
him until you've saved everyone.

Head south and talk to every villager you come across.  More often than not,
you'll have to fight one in battle.  While in combat, look carefully because
there are actually two things you can attack.  One is the villager, and the
other is a demon called "Chiroru."  Attack the Chiroru (the object that's
covering the face of the villager), but don't attack the villager or you
won't save him.  Once you defeat the Chiroru, you will have saved the
villager.

In all, you must rescue six villagers in the entire well:  a Chiroru
possesses four villagers, and two villagers are standing by themselves
normally.  Simply talk to those two villagers to "save" them.

Once you've saved all six villagers, head back to Ray and tell him yes.  The
wave will come splashing down, and you'll surface up.  Ray will thank you and
want to give you a blessing from St. Eva: a spell.

If you did in fact save all six villagers, he will give you a very useful
spell called "Renew," which has a 70% chance of bringing someone back to life
after they become unconscious.  If you saved less than six, you will be
rewarded with the Cure2 spell, which is arguably a more useful spell.  To get
your reward, you have to go all the way back to the Ruins.  Exit Capitan and
begin trekking all the way back.

You can't use Windia to get to the other side of the continent, so you'll
have to find another way.  First, make sure Sten is in the lead of your
marching order while on the map.  Have him grab onto the nearby stake by
standing as close as you can to it, and by pressing the Y BUTTON on the
Controller to activate his special power.  Once you get to the other side,
you should remember where to go in order to get to the Ruins.  It will take a
while but you'll end up there eventually.

| fully restored, and once Ryu exits the house, the rest of your current      |
| party will have full HP and AP.                                             |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Once you get to the Ruins, you should notice that it's not called "Ruins"
anymore, but instead, "TownShip" (check the status screen).  Bow has built
another house and it seems the old building has been repaired completely.  
Enter the building, and Ray will offer to give you the Renew magic, but
first, head into the next room and talk with everyone.

Now it's time for you to make a decision, whom will you give this spell to?  
There's good reason to, at the very least, eliminate two candidates:  Bow and
Rand.  Both will learn Renew on their own as they grow in levels.  So now,
you have a choice of Ryu, Katt, Nina, and Sten.  Katt and Sten are obviously
not good choices because they have a low maximum AP count.  It now comes down
to either Ryu or Nina.  Nina has more AP, but Ryu will always stay in your
party no matter what.  Ryu isn't necessarily a spell caster, while Nina is
more of one.  Whatever you choose, both are good choices, but Nina might be
the best choice since she her magic repertoire seems to be more offensive
based.

Now that you've given the spell to whomever you chose, talk to Niro and
change up your members.  It would be good of you to have a party of Ryu,
Rand, Katt, and Sten.  While your Rand may only be at LV 7 or so, you want to
power him up now that he can join your party, so later you won't be
regretting the opportunity when you need him.  As for Sten, you must have
Sten in your party if you ever plan on getting to the next continent.

By the way, from now on, whenever you talk to a dragon shrine you will have
the ability to change characters, so you won't have to head back to Town
Ship/Ruins and talk to Niro.

Your next stop is back to the town of Capitan.

Once you return to Capitan, you'll notice a person that stands out quite a bit
and is standing between the inn and house next to it.  Talk to the person while
Ryu is in the lead of your marching order, and she'll ask to "borrow" him for a
minute.  You'll now end up in a weird looking hut.

Ryu is without the rest of your party now, with what appears to be an old
looking woman and the same person that brought you here.  "Sana" explains why
she brought you here and tells you she wanted to experiment the act of
"uniting."  Anyway, Sana's grandmother, "Granny," eventually fills you in of
what's going on, and asks you to join with Sana by going to the center
circle.  Do so.

The uniting power is so strong that Sana and Granny realize Ryu isn't any
ordinary man.  He has the power of the dragons and the uniting fails.  Not
only that, the extent of the damage done from the uniting is so significant,
that all of Jah Woods burns to a crisp.  They then ask you to find them a new
house, in return for them 'helping' you discover your newfound powers.

You're now back on the field.  While you may think you have to go all the way
back to TownShip, you don't.  Go back to Capitan (just a little south of
where you are right now), and talk to the man standing where Sana used to be
(near the inn).  The game will whisk Ryu, Sana, and Granny back to TownShip.

Sana and Granny then immediately fall in love with the house Bow has
finished, and a funny scene takes place.  Afterwards, you find yourself in
Bow's room.  Head back to Niro to setup your party, and put in Rand, Katt,
and Sten like last time.  Now talk to Granny and Sana, and they'll tell you
to go find a "carpenter" in Capitan.  Go all the way back to Capitan.

Once you reach Capitan, there will be a decision you will have to make.  
First, note that there are three different types of houses in Capitan.
Inside each type of house is a carpenter you can talk to help build your town
of TownShip.  However, you can only pick one carpenter and each carpenter
brings different things to the town.  Here is a table detailing the three
types of carpenters, where they're located in town, and what you get from
each carpenter if you pick him.

Type           Location In Town      What You Get
====           =================     ============
Regular        Easternmost house     Ability to cook items
Tree           Middle houses         An Othello-like game for average items
Futuristic     Westernmost house     A Pub-like house with customers telling
you miscellaneous stats about your game

Apparently the game will not have all three carpenters available to you if you
didn't save all six villagers.  The only carpenter who will always be available
no matter how many villagers you saved is the "Regular" carpenter.

The best carpenter is in the regular looking house.  He's the best because he
is the only one that can "cook" items for you.  He can help you get your
characters to have maximum stats if you can bring him the right ingredients.
If stat boosting matters little to you, feel free to choose either of the
other two carpenters, but once you make your decision you will not be able
to go back and change, so don't make your decision hastily.

Once you've decided which carpenter you want, head north of town to enter a
harbor.  You'll be able to pass because there is a boat is ready for you to
use.  You'll also learn more about the thief you're after; she's been spotted
at a place called "SimaFort"

o-------------------------------o

There's nothing special here.  Keep walking, and you'll automatically ride a
boat to the other side of the continent.  You can save/change characters at
the dragon shrine, too.

You'll now be at the map.  Enter the forest opening near the sign.

                                       *

o-------------------------------o

Follow the path and you'll reach some frogs.  Then, suddenly, someone starts
talking to you.  A gigantic frog comes out of the swamp.  He tells you his
name is "Jean" and that a witch put a spell on him to turn him into his
current form.  Jean asks you to go to the witch's tower and reverse the spell
for him.

Before you do, you'll want to raise your characters a few levels, and make
sure that everyone is wearing the best possible equipment from Windia.  At
this point in the game, the best place to gain levels is a little south of
the woods, and then west across a bridge (south of the big pond) near a hut
that's all alone.

                                       *

o-------------------------------o

Inside this hut, a man will ask you if you wish to sleep out in the open, which
actually counts as a free rest for all your characters.

Keep building levels and resting until you're at LV 14.  If you find an S.Idol,
defeat it and you may end up with an StoneAR.  This is a great piece of armor
for Rand!  Also, another enemy around this area drops the JahAR, another piece
of great equipment.

Once you're done leveling, from the hut, head north until finding a tower all
by itself.  Enter the tower when you're ready.  Make sure you have a good
supply of curing items as well.

If you're having trouble finding the tower here are some directions from the
hut:  go north across the small bridge, then keep going northeast up three
levels of land.  You'll find the tower just a few steps east after you get
to the third level of land.

o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Once you enter, you'll notice a tile.  Make sure Ryu is in the lead of the
marching order and step on it; you'll now have to fight a battle.  Keep
stepping on it until the voice opens the way for you.  The number of battles
seems to be random.  I've had the witch open the passageway after only two
battles, while sometimes it would take four battles.  It seems the witch only
wants Ryu to step on the tile.

Once you can continue, don't open the treasure chest you see out in front.
It's empty, and it will block off the entrance for good, so you won't be able
to exit the tower until later on.

Head left from the main room for a treasure chest, but if you don't care about
getting it, head right into the next room.  Keep following this path until you
reach a room with five platforms and a huge gap.  Each platform will take you
to a different part of the room.  Here's how it will look like:

o---------------------------------o
|     Room of 5 Platforms Map     |

|       |_| |_| |_| |_| |_|       |

|                                 |
| 1   = Right Exit To Continue    |
| 2&3 = Fall Into Treasure Room   |
| 4   = Stairs To Treasure Room   |
| 5   = Left Exit To Water Shaman |
o---------------------------------o

Take Platforms 2,3, or 4 to fall down into the treasure room, and nab all those
treasure chests.  Note:  If you took Platforms 2 and 3 you will need to start
all over from the 1st floor to get back to the Room of 5 Platforms, but if you
took Platform 4, you can get back just by going back up the stairs again as
Platform 4--which you just took--will be available to you so you can go back.

After getting the treasures, head back up, and this time, head to the right
exit by taking Platform 1.  There's nothing for you at the moment if you head
into the left exit because the "Water Shaman" can't help you now since she's
turned to stone.  (After you finish with your objective in the tower,
you'll be able to get her help.)

Once you're through with that room, continue until reaching the Step-On-Tiles
Room.  This room is the most confusing of all in the tower.  There are 15 tiles
and 4 gates.

o------------------------------------------o

Procedure
=========
1.  Step on Tile 3 to open Gate 1
2.  Step on Tile 7 to open Gate 2
3.  Step on Tiles 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 to open Gate 3
4.  Step on Tile 6 to open Gate 4

Your main goal is to open Gate 4.  However, I listed instructions (above) on
how to have all four gates open, so you can get all the treasure chests.

Once you're done with the above, you'll now be on the 5th floor.  You can
exit the tower immediately, if you like, by falling out of the opening on the
right side.  I suggest you do so if you are low on HP/AP and Herbs.  If you
feel you're up to it, continue.

On the final floor, step on the tile.  Now before continuing even further,
make sure your HP is full.  You'll meet "Nimufu," the witch you've been
after, who will want to "play" with you.  You decide to leave, but she starts
to get angry because nobody seems to like her, and then decides to fight you
in retaliation.

##################
# Boss Battle 12 #
# Nimufu         #
##################

Have Ryu open up by casting Fire/Ice/Thunder Puppy (all three do the same
amount of damage) and have Katt attack.  Sten should cast Bomb and Rand should
attack.  Nimufu may counterattack with a spell called Thunder, which can knock
off a good 30 points of damage to each member.  Be careful; she can also cast
Cure 1 and some other spells.  Have Katt and Sten use Herbs when needed.  In
this case, Rand should cast Cure 1 if you absolutely need it, but he's slow so
it may not be a good idea to rely on him alone.

Once you defeat Nimufu, she'll start crying and say that the only one that
likes her is some "frog."  Then, she'll open up and tell you that a young
girl needs to kiss the frog if you want to change him back to normal.

Now, before leaving the tower, head all the way back to the room where there
were five platforms you could step on, and enter the left passageway this
time; look at the map above if you need help.  Continue, and you'll find a
woman--if you tried going here before, she was actually a statue--who'll tell
you she's a Water Shaman named "Seso."  Seso will tell you she will head to
TownShip and wait for you.

Leave the tower, but before doing so, make sure you get all those coins in
those treasure chests at the bottom of the tower if you haven't by now, because
you'll need the money later.

Back on the map, head back to the woods where you met the frog.

o-------------------------------o

Put either Katt or Nina in the lead of your marching order, and then talk to
the frog.  After the kiss, the woods will explode, and Jean will turn back to
his 'normal self.'  Jean tells you he is a king (actually he's a prince, but
the translators messed up) of a castle called SimaFort.  Jean will now join
your party, and you can add him to your current party (please do so).  He
starts at LV 10 but if you bring him along, you'll level him up in no time.

As you leave the woods, the game will tell you that your hideout--TownShip--is
now becoming a real town.  Don't head for SimaFort just yet because there
are some side quests you can do right now that will make you far more powerful
and ready for what lies ahead.  One of the side quests is to visit a nearby
restaurant called WildCat.  This will be the last side quest we'll do before
going to SimaFort.

Before even heading back to TownShip, though, head northwest of the woods
and you'll find a lake near a waterfall.  On the map, and while Jean is in
the lead of the marching order, press the Y BUTTON on the Controller to
activate Jean's special power and make him turn back into his Gigantic Frog
form.  You can swim into the waterfall to find a hidden cave.  Do so.

| If any of your members are poisoned while outside on the map, have Jean in  |

o-----------------------------------------------------------o

Put Ryu in the lead of the marching order, and open the treasure chests.  Talk
to the man inside, and he'll give Ryu some new dragon powers, which are
extremely powerful at this point in the game.

There's nothing else left to do here, so just leave after getting the new
powers.  Head back to TownShip, and make sure Sten is in your party so he
can gain some experience points along the way.  Use Jean's special power
while on the map to hop and get there a whole lot quicker than normally.

| 1C:        Of the 2nd set of three houses, search the easternmost house's |
|            cabinet.                                                       |
o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Explore the new houses and then enter the Unity room.  Talk to Granny and
try uniting different shamans with different people.  At this point in the
game you should only have the Fire and Water Shamans, Sana and Seso.

How to unite shamans with your characters:  You can unite up to two different
shamans with one character.  For instance, if it were possible, you could
unite both the Water and Fire Shamans with Jean.  However, that is not
possible because some shamans aren't compatible with certain characters.  For
example, it's obvious that Jean is more of a water elemental kind of
character rather than a fire one because frogs like water and don't like
heat.

To unite, talk to Granny and she'll ask you if you need an explanation.  The
game messes up here, and confuses the options "Yes" with "No," so if you want
the explanation, say "No."  Once you say "Yes," the game will bring you four
different options:  Unite, List, Undo, and Cancel.

Unite
=====
Use this to experiment fusing different shamans with characters.  If you
aren't up to using the trial and error method, look below for a list of
compatible shamans and characters at this point in the game.

List
====
This shows you what you have done--in terms of uniting shamans and
characters--that has worked successfully.  This is a huge helper because you
won't have to memorize which shamans work with certain characters after you
get a correct fusion.  Simply look under the character for the right shaman
combination and select it to get that fusion immediately.

Undo
====
This undoes the shaman you united with a character.  However, you really
don't need this option if you have an item called "DivideBL," which is inside
the chest in the Unity room.  DivideBL cancels the uniting on the selected
character and you can use it as many times as you want.

Cancel
======
This option can be confusing.  It doesn't necessarily cancel the uniting as
Undo will do; it actually ends it.  Suppose you only want to fuse just the
Water Shaman, Seso, with Jean, but don't want to fuse any other shamans; you
have to select Cancel to start the uniting process.  In other words, select
this option anytime you want to fuse just o-n-e shaman with a character, and
not two.

Here's what you can do now with your current characters and shamans:

Character     Shaman     Bonuses           Appearance
=========     ======     =======           ==========
Rand          Sana               +Off.     -
Rand          Seso       +Wisdom           -
Nina          Sana               +Off.     -
Nina          Seso       +Wisdom           -
Sten          Sana               +Off.     Red
Sten          Seso       +Wisdom           -
Jean          Seso       +Wisdom           -

(Note:  A "-" [dash] sign under the Appearance column indicates the character
does not show a change in his or her appearance.)

It would be a good idea to bring Sten along, and have him unite with Sana, so
you can take a look at how different he looks in his new reddish hue.  Unite
Seso with either Jean or Nina.  Note that Ryu will never be able to unite with
shamans during the entire course of the game, and right now, Katt cannot unite
with any of your current shamans.

Now, you'll want to go find some tenants for the three new houses that have
been built.  You should explore the world of Breath of Fire II and look
everywhere; or if all else fails, read on.

Once you pick a tenant, you can't go back and replace him or her because each
tenant is assigned to a particular house.  You see, TownShip will only have a
limited number of houses available--far fewer than the number of total tenants
in the game, so you will never be able to get all the tenants and you must make
a choice.  You currently have three open houses available and later on you will
get a set of an additional three houses giving you six total houses and thus,
six total tenants you can recruit.

To get a tenant to come to TownShip, simply talk to the person and say yes
when they ask you if they can open up a shop.  They'll automatically be in
TownShip the next time you drop by.  If they don't ask to come to TownShip,
it usually means you've already filled the House they would have occupied
with another Tenant.

Arguably, there are only two Tenants who are considered the absolute "best"
for their respective Houses.  I have yet to get each and every tenant in
the game, so you may want to refer to a specialized in-depth guide on tenants.

Just to be clear, most of the benefits you'll receive are not very good.  For
example, Kay (a possible tenant for House 1)'s vaccine shot will give your
party immunity to poison, but it is not permanent and goes away extremely
quickly.  Don't worry too much about picking the "best" tenant because there is
no overall consensus on who's the best except for Baretta for House 3 and
Barose for House 4.

My personal recommendations for each House are (based on usefulness):

o---------------------o
| Recommended Tenants |
| ------------------- |
| House 1:  Hekkeller |
| House 2:  Leminton  |
| House 3:  Baretta   |
| House 4:  Barose    |
| House 5:  Hanz      |
| House 6:  Daiye     |
o---------------------o

Those are the tenants I will show you how to get.  If you would like to
explore other possible tenants, I highly suggest you take a look at a
specialized guide dedicated to tenants and make the appropriate recruiting
sessions when required.  (Not all tenants will be available for recruiting
right now.)

For Houses 1, 2, and 3 you can get the recommended tenants right now.  Here
is a table showing where they're located followed by a description of what they
give you:

House     Tenant        Location
=====     ======        ========
1         Hekkeller     Home Town, next to Ryu/Bow's house
2         Leminton      2nd floor of Capitan's inn
3         Baretta       Windia's armory

Hekkeller opens up a nice shop that sells some awesome fire equipment, but
they're quite expensive.  Try saving up your coins for one of the powerful
weapons.

Leminton also opens up another shop that sells some darn good stuff, but not
as good as what Hekkeller sells.  Buy from him if you're low on coins.

Baretta opens up a shop that will, now, only sell outdated equipment, but
later on in the game, will sell some very good stuff (including some of the
best possible equipment you can get in th game).  For now though, just
leave her alone and don't waste your coins on what's she's offering at the
moment.

I suggest you get these three tenants so that you can buy all their powerful
equipment, and so you won't have to worry about how strong your characters
are for the time being.  Once you get the tenants to join you, spend all your
coins on the equipment they sell.

After filling the three Houses, talk to the carpenter, but make sure Ryu is in
the lead of the marching order.  He'll ask you if he should continue building
TownShip and expand it even more.  Say yes, and pay him 1000 coins.  Now, if
you're impatient and want to see how TownShip will look expanded, keep entering
and exiting TownShip about eight times and the town will automatically change.
Now there are six Houses instead of just three.  You can get a lousy coin by
searching one of the medicine cabinets in one of the new set of Houses.  
Anyhow, for now, you can't invite anyone into these new Houses because the
tenants are in places you have yet to visit in the game.

Your next stop is "Wild Cat," a cave next to the waterfall where you got the
new dragon powers for Ryu.  Make sure everyone is around LV 15; level up
those characters that are low in experience so that everyone is around the
same level.  A great place to gain EXP and coins is south of the woods where
you found Jean.

Talk to the guard and answer by saying yes to him when he asks you if you
wish to check in.  Read the signs and follow each sign's directions.  Leave
your hats, jackets, weapons, and shields.  Then say yes when the sign asks
you to rub yourself in pepper and salt.  The last sign will ask you how you
want your meal done, say "Rare" (don't choose either of the other two
choices).  Note:  If you do not follow the directions you will be forced to
fight a small boss each time.

Now, continue into the next room and step on the grill.  You'll now be
hopping mad on it because it's so hot.  "Cook" will come out and want to chop
you into bits, so you'll have to fight him stripped of all your armor and
weapons.  In addition, your characters will lose some HP because of the grill
being so hot.

##################
# Boss Battle 13 #
# WildCat        #
##################

Have Ryu cast any of his new dragon powers (ThunderDrgn, FireDrgn, IceDrgn) and
it'll knock off a whopping 512 points of damage if his AP is at max.  Have Sten
cast Flame, and Nina cast S.Boom.  Jean should attack, but you won't really
need to rely on his efforts because you should defeat WildCat in the first
round of combat.

After the fight, Cook will begin to feel some pain and head into the next
room.  Follow him, and you should be in some sort of a bar.  Talk to the cook
to the right and he'll begin to ask you some yes or no questions.  It would
be a good idea if you answer them the following way:

Cook Q & A Dialogue
===================
Question 1:  Are you mad that I tried to turn you into steaks?
Answer   1:  No
Question 2:  You are softhearted, aren't you?
Answer   2:  Yes

Cook should then be thankful to you for forgiving him, and will want to teach
you something "new":  a spell.

However, if you answer him differently, he will give a boost of 16 HP to all
the party members.

Now, you can go back to the hut with the dragon shrine and change your party
members if you don't currently have the character you wish to learn the
spell.  The spell Cook will teach you is called "Chop Chop"; it uses up 0 AP
and will deal about 50-70 points of damage to a single enemy.  It's one of the
more useful spells in the game since it's an unblockable spell and doesn't
factor in an enemy's defense.

It would be wise of you to give it to someone you know will be in your party
for most of the game (like Katt).  Sten, Katt, and Nina are the best choices.  
Ryu is also another option.  If you just can't decide, give it to Nina since
she's an offensive based character, and most of her current spells don't do
as much damage as Chop Chop will inflict.

Once you've decided, leave Wild Cat and now you'll be done with the first set
of optional side quests in Breath of Fire II.  Congratulations.

Back to the main course of the game, your next destination is SimaFort.  
SimaFort is located in the center of the lake, east of Wild Cat.  To get to
SimaFort you'll have to swim there; to be able to swim, you have to put Jean
in the lead of your marching order and activate his special power to turn into
a gigantic frog by pressing the Y BUTTON on the Controller.

| DluxPole:  In the room you wake up in, search the medicine cabinet.         |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

If you enter at nighttime, rest like the guard tells you to because you can't
enter SimaFort until daytime.  You can leave SimaFort at any time by having
Jean in the lead of your marching order and by activating his special power
while outside the main castle.  The stairs can't be used for now, so enter
through the main door.

Once inside, Jean will start to boast and tell everyone the prince is back.  
All the citizens of SimaFort seem dismayed and don't respond.  Suddenly, some
soldiers take a hold of Jean and, who appears to be prince of SimaFort,
greets you.  He apologizes on his behalf for the commotion, and tells you
that Jean is really an imposter and not the real prince.  For now, you really
don't know what to believe, and the (assumed) real prince asks you to leave.
Saying no to him won't do anything so say yes.  You could explore the castle
and talk to everyone, but just leave.

Once you're out of the main castle, you'll find someone named "Petape," who
throws a boulder at the ship you were supposed to depart on, and causes it to
sink.  Suddenly, she throws you all into the water, and soldiers appear.  
They think you left since your ship isn't around anymore.  You then realize
that Jean is not the imposter the "real prince" said he was.  After the
soldiers leave, the party begins to sink.  Before it's too late, Petape
rescues them.

You now wake up in some room, and Ryu finally gains consciousness.  You
realize Petape is the actual princess of SimaFort.  Petape will ask you to
save her brother, Jean (the one thrown in jail).  Petape can also give you
some more info so listen to her.  Say yes when she asks you if you'll save
Jean, and she'll give you a special item called "Gills."  These will allow
you to breathe underwater (though you won't be able to suddenly move through
the ocean on the maps with these).

Petape tells you to find the underground dungeon and look for Jean.  To get
there, remember those stairs in the outside part of the castle that you
couldn't enter?  Now you can enter them, so go down the stairs, and you
should be underwater.

Head into the left opening; the right opening will only take you out of
SimaFort--remember this in case you want to build up levels or need to leave.  
Go up the next flight of stairs, and you'll end up inside the castle.

Head into the room to the north, keep heading up (through the small
passageway between the two cells), and then go down the stairs.  You'll now
be in a jail room and hear a conversation.  "Leader" will ask you if you want
to save Jean; say yes and you'll have to fight him.  The battle with "Jailer"
is so easy you shouldn't have any problems defeating him.

Once you've defeated Jailer, Petape will come over and open the cell.  Talk
to Jean and say, "help you" when he asks you a question.  Jean says he
doesn't mind being a plain old fogy rather than a prince, and Petape begins
to cry.  Jean then tells you of a "Royal Ring" which may ultimately prove who
is the real prince.  Jean tells you that he gave the ring to a witch, more
specifically Nimufu.  Anyway, now you must exit SimaFort and go find Nimufu.  
She's actually not at her tower anymore, but at Wild Cat--you remember where
that is don't you?

Once you reach Wild Cat, head back into the bar room where Cook was, and
you'll notice a whole lot of witches around here.  You can get some info
about Nimufu, and even battle one of them.  Nimufu is actually in the
bathroom, so go inside and talk to her.  She tells you she dropped the ring
into the toilet so you'll have to go inside to find it.  Jump into the
toilet.

| Royal R.*:  Grab the ring at the south part, then get it back at the north. |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Don't be alarmed; there aren't any monsters in here, and it's not a real
dungeon.  Head south and try grabbing the ring.  It'll float to the other end
of the small lake.  Head north and then grab it for good.  Now you got what
you were looking for, so exit.

As you're leaving, Nimufu will question your motive, and you explain to her
that it's not just any ordinary ring you were after.  She doesn't believe
that someone would ever give her something so extravagant and valuable
because she doesn't feel that anyone actually loves her.  It seems Jean must
have liked the poor witch.

All you can do is to leave Wild Cat and head back into SimaFort.  However,
before riding the boat back, head into the hut and change members.  Add Rand
or Katt to the party so that you have four members and then rest up.  Now enter
SimaFort.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go back into Jean's cellar and talk to Jean.  He'll be somewhat happy you
found the ring and start singing.

You'll end up in front of the king and the imposter will show up as well.  To
your surprise, the imposter also has the same exact ring Jean has.  
Therefore, it seems that your efforts were in vain.  However, a small ray of
hope is still left, as the king will ask for some fly pudding--a delicacy
only the true prince of SimaFort knows how to make.  Next, the imposter
challenges you to a cooking contest.  The goal is to make the best meal for
the king; whoever wins will be declared the true prince.  If Jean loses
however, the entire party, as well as Jean, will be executed.

This is your only chance to prove that Jean really is the prince, so you end
up in the kitchen.  Jean asks you to find three key ingredients in order for
him to prepare the perfect meal.  The three ingredients can be found in the
dungeon of the basement of SimaFort.  The ingredients are:  "WormMeat,"
"RochMeat," and "GoldFly."

From the kitchen, find the king's chambers and enter the right opening
(behind the throne).  Go up the flight of stairs, and search in front of the
arrow pointing south (by pressing the A BUTTON on the Controller) to have
the painting move.  A secret entrance appears, enter it.

Go up the next flight of stairs and you'll find "Tata," a soldier tied up and
begging for some water.  Help him by saying yes, and he'll mention someone
named "Fiolina."

Find Fiolina by heading downstairs from the king's chambers--she's the woman
staring in front of the small pond.  Talk to her and she'll ask you if you've
seen Tata, her boyfriend, around.  Say yes and she'll go and rescue him.  If
you talk to her before saving Tata and tell her that you've seen him around,
she'll know that you're lying.

Follow her to where Tata was originally, and talk to Tata.  He'll thank you,
and asks you if there is anything he can do to help.  If you say "money," it
seems your dragon meter will change (probably for the worst).  Both choices
will end up giving you the same result.  He will also give you two keys,
which you can use to unlock the doors in both buildings nearby.

Unlock the building to the left of Tata and grab the chest for a cool stash
of 1000 coins, but don't bother going down the flight of stairs because
you'll end up in a dead end.  Unlock the other building (the windmill) and
fall into the buckets going down.  You should now end up on the lower level.  
Follow this path and you'll finally find the dungeon Petape was talking
about.

You'll run into a soldier trying to capture the famous GoldFly.  He'll be
defeated by it, and the fly will challenge you to a fight.  Just keep
attacking it, and after about four or five rounds, it'll fly away.  In fact,
you can just defend and heal yourself for those four or five rounds and it
will still fly away.

Enter the room nearby (don't enter the room all the way north just yet).  
You'll run into the fly again and it'll fly away (again).  Keep following
this path until reaching the bridge.  Make sure your HP is full, and a
gigantic worm will break up the bridge and attack you.

##################
# Boss Battle 14 #
# J.Worm         #
##################

Have Ryu cast any of his best dragon powers (not the puppy ones) to knock off a
good 500 points of damage.  Have Rand constantly attack the worm and cure
anyone if necessary.  Have Sten cast Chop Chop or Flame, and Nina should cast
S.Boom.  After Ryu casts his dragon power, make sure he constantly attacks the
J.Worm.  If it puts some of your characters to sleep, don't bother waking them
up, as it will usually attack them to wake them up soon enough.  This battle
shouldn't take any more than four rounds of fighting if your characters are
around LV 15.

After the fight, you'll end up with one of the key ingredients.  The Gold Fly
will then taunt you.  It may be a good idea to go to the inn of SimaFort and
restore your characters' HP and AP so you'll be ready for the next half of
the dungeon.

Once you're prepared, go back to the main room (first room) of the dungeon
and enter the north doorway.  Follow this path battling the blue roaches and
getting the out-of-the-way chests.  Once you're at the end, you'll face a big
roach.

##################
# Boss Battle 15 #
# G.Roach        #
##################

This boss is pathetic.  It seems its weakness is fire, so have Ryu attack
hopefully you bought the "FireSD" from Hekkeller in TownShip), Rand attack,
Sten cast Flame, and Nina cast S.Boom.  There should be no need for curing
whatsoever, but if you need to, then use the usual Herbs or HelpBLs.

After the very easy battle, you'll end up with the second key ingredient Jean
needs, two down, and one more to go.  Continue north to face the GoldFly,
this time, for the last time.  Make sure Ryu has full, or very close to full,
AP, so he can do some costly damage with those new dragon powers.

##################
# Boss Battle 16 #
# GoldFly        #
##################

Have Ryu cast his dragon power, Rand attack, Sten cast Flame/ChopChop, and Nina
cast S.Boom.  You should take the GoldFly out in two rounds if you followed
this strategy.

Afterwards, you'll end up with the last of the three key ingredients.  All
that's left to do is to leave the dungeon and go find Jean in the kitchen.  
Talk to Jean, and you'll give him the ingredients; he'll ask you to go wait
in the dining room.

Go to the dining room, talk to the guard to the south, and the contest will
begin.  The food will be prepared on the table and the head cook will taste
each dish made by the imposter and Jean.  The head chef will say that the
imposter's dishes taste better; the other cooks also agree, but it's obvious
they are lying just to make the imposter happy.

As a last resort, Jean asks the party to taste the food.  Do so by pressing
the A BUTTON on the Controller in front of each of the three plates.  
Unfortunately, humans just can't seem to eat this stuff.  The party will spit
the food out, and Petape will be outraged and threaten to blow up the castle.

The imposter, Jean, and Petape will then storm off into an unknown area in
the castle and the head cook will tell you about a secret bathroom elevator
that may lead you to them.  Before finding it, rest at the inn to restore
your HP and AP.

The elevator can be found by going into the north opening from the dining
room, down the stairs, and then into the room marked "WC."  Press the A
BUTTON on the Controller while standing in front of the arrow pointing down
to take the elevator.  Now, instead of heading south after the elevator takes
you to the lower floor, head into the little opening just to the right of
where the bathroom is and you'll find yourself in a new area.

Before you continue into the new area, make sure you are fully prepared:
Everyone should be at or near full health.  Also, check that no one hasn't
lost his or her shaman-bonded form (if applicable), and that everyone has
the best possible equipment you can buy at this point.

Once you've decided you're ready, continue through this area and you'll find
Jean, who's hurt.  You'll meet up with the imposter and he'll turn into a
demon named "Kuwadora."

##################
# Boss Battle 17 #
# Kuwadora       #
##################

He's big and a whole lot tougher than any other boss you've faced thus far.  It
might be a good idea to have Ryu be at LV 16 or higher for this battle.  Have
Ryu cast his dragon power to knock off 500 points of damage, Rand attack
constantly, Sten cast Chop Chop or attack, and Nina cast S.Boom.  Use items
like "F.Spice" or battle-only items if you have them.  To really make short
work of Kuwadora, have Ryu cast his dragon powers twice by giving him W.Fruit
after the first time to restore his AP.

After the battle, Kuwadora will try to explode the castle, but instead,
explodes himself.  Jean tells everyone to calm down, and that it really
wasn't an explosion device, rather a stronghold for a legendary sword.  Jean
lied about it to scare burglars away, but it seems Petape bought into the
whole story her entire life.

It turns out Petape and Jean are just fine and they leave to find the king.
Now that you have control of your party, pull the sword out, and get the
"SoleSD."  Now leave the room, and you'll end up in the king's chamber.

The king will apologize, and Jean will want to go an extra step further and
join your party for good.  You also find out that the king had a spell put on
him so that's why he couldn't recognize his own son, Jean.

Now that you have Jean in your party, Petape and the king will tell you to
take whatever you wish from the castle.

Find the very large room where there are a few cooks and a cockroach pit.  
There should be a set of stairs going up, and you should be hearing someone
named "Patty" yelling constantly.  Head up the stairs and open the three
chests, then go back down and talk to the cook guarding the insane woman.  It
turns out this is the thief you've been looking for all this time.  Finally,
you can clear Bow's name.

Now that you have Patty, the thief, in your party (technically she isn't, but
the game just says so), head all the way back to HomeTown.  Oh, and about
the SoleSD, have Jean equip that since Ryu can equip a whole lot of better
weapons that you can buy at the shops in TownShip.

Once you exit SimaFort, notice that the map music changes.  This seems to be
a theme in the Breath of Fire games:  After every important task you
accomplish, the music changes to signal a new chapter of the game.

Once you enter Trout's house, you'll show the real thief, Patty, to Trout.  
Patty then immediately accuses Trout of stealing the treasure in the first
place, and that all she did was take it back to its rightful owner.  Patty
then claims that Trout has several thieves working for him in his basement.  
Trout asks you to go search his house and see if you can find anything to
prove that she's lying.

Find a set of stairs and go down them.  As you can see, there's really
nothing around in the basement.  Go back up the stairs and Trout will ask you
if you seen anything.  You haven't, and then Trout asks you to leave his
house now that everything is out in the open.  Once you're outside, Kilgore
runs into you, and asks you if Bow's name is finally clear.  You tell Kilgore
what just happened, and he begs you to bring Bow to him so he can apologize
for asking him to steal that treasure.  Well, you know where Bow is, don't
you?  Next stop:  TownShip.

Once you enter TownShip, talk to Niro and change your party.  Notice that
you can now finally add Bow to your party.  Now put him in there.  By the
way, here are the current possible shaman combinations for Bow:

Back at HomeTown, enter Kilgore's house and make sure Bow is in the lead of
the marching order.  Talk to Kilgore, and he'll apologize for what he asked
Bow to do.  You end up at the dining table and Kilgore apologizes while you
all eat dinner.  Suddenly, and unexpectedly, he asks Bow to steal for him
again.  Kilgore tells you that there is something awfully suspicious about
Trout, and he can't stop thinking about him.  Bow agrees and decides to take
on the task.  Bow then asks Ryu if he wishes to come along with him.  If you
want Ryu to come with Bow, say yes twice or else you'll just end up entering
Trout's house as Bow alone.  Once you decide, you'll immediately fight a
battle with a "Footman."  Easily dispatch of him by attacking him.  You'll
now be back inside Trout's house.

Be careful; there are a lot of Footmen in here.  Your goal is to get to the
stairs.  Enter them to get to the basement, and then go back up to the main
floor.  You'll spot Trout, and he'll come from a secret entrance.  Bow and
Ryu hide so Trout doesn't see them.  Enter the set of stairs in the next room
up.

You'll end up in a new area of the basement.  Talk with the people locked up
and they'll tell you that Trout asked them to steal for him, and then jailed
them.  You'll spot Patty in chains, too.  Talk to Patty and she'll tell you
"I told you so!"  Well, now that you know who the real bad guy is, you decide
to trust Patty.  Trout comes back to check up on Patty and notices you.  He
asks Bow if he'd be willing to steal for him.  Of course, Bow isn't that
naive, and refuses.  Trout gets angry, and he decides he wants to kill you.

##################
# Boss Battle 18 #
# Trout          #
##################

Have Ryu open up by casting his dragon powers.  After that, just have Ryu and
Bow continue to attack Trout, and he should be defeated in seconds.

After Trout dies, Patty compliments Bow on his 'killing monsters' talent, but
laughs at his stealing ability.  Ah well, the good thing is that you helped
save Patty and found out who Trout really is.  Patty gives you the "Magic
Hood"--Kilgore's stolen treasure--and you end up back at Kilgore's house.

Bow explains to Kilgore and the gang what happened, and Kilgore thanks you
deeply.  Bow offers to give back the Magic Hood, but Kilgore refuses and asks
you to keep it.  Bow then asks Ryu if he thinks that something bad is going
to happen.  It doesn't matter what you say, and then a cut scene takes place.  
It appears something bad really is going to happen.  For now though, it's
best not to worry what it is.

You'll end up outside Kilgore's house, and now Bow can finally travel with
you on your adventures.  As you're leaving HomeTown, a woman stands in your
way.  Talk to her; "Silvia" asks Ryu and Bow to go back to the guild.  You'll
automatically end up at the guild, and the rangers speak of a very large
demon that was spotted at Gate--the place where Ryu first met Bow in the very
beginning.  The Rangers decide to quit their jobs because the task seems
impossible, and they want nothing to do with it.  Ryu and Bow then realize
the demon the rangers are speaking of is the very same demon that they were
defeated by in the cave near Gate.

The elder asks more questions to Ryu and Bow.  Then Silvia appears and tells
the Elder that Bow defeated one of the other demons, Trout.  Silvia then
kisses Bow for a little reward.  You then hear of a "Grass Man," who you
might want to find since he has the power to communicate with the trees and
forest, and could ask them what happened at Gate.

Anyway you look at it, your next task is a big one.  Exit HomeTown and head
all the way back to the continent where you found SimaFort and the Witch
Tower.  Head south, past the streams, by using Jean's special power to turn
into a gigantic frog, and then east until finding a house all by itself at
the tip of the peninsula; enter it.

Change your party members using the dragon shrine, and make sure you add Katt
to your party if you haven't already.  Enter the house and talk to the man
inside.  He'll tell you that he was one of the people that were held captive
by Trout.  He thanks you, and as a token of his appreciation, asks that you
see the Whale Cave.  Continue, and fall down into the hole.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Once you're inside, have Katt in the lead of the marching order, and activate
her special power (by pressing the Y BUTTON on the Controller) to break open
the fragile gate.  Fall down even further and you'll meet up with an old man
named "Maiyoru."  He explains that you're inside a giant whale named
"Grandpa," and that he hasn't been responding to him lately.  "Tree" and
"Ton"--the two baby whales--say that Grandpa swallowed an evil stone doll.  
This doll could be responsible for Grandpa not responding since it supposedly
puts things to sleep.  Maiyoru says that he may have spotted the doll
somewhere near the stomach area of Grandpa.  Anyway, Maiyoru says it's about
time he head back to his house at the beach and asks you to drop by sometime.

If you're not prepared to enter a dungeon right now, enter the mouth opening
and go back to the room where you met Maiyoru.  Tree and Ton should be
waiting for you, and will let you ride on them to get out.  Once you're
prepared, enter the mouth opening and continue north to enter the "Whale
Tunnels."

You should now be in a small room with an Adam's apple you can whack with
Katt's stick by activating her special power.  Nothing happens when you whack
it though, so just continue north into the next room.

This room is quite large and can be confusing.  There's only one way to go,
and that's up.  Go into the next room.

You should now be in a room that features some cobwebs hanging from the
ceiling.  There are three ways you can proceed in this room:  left, up, or
right.  Left takes you to a dead end, up takes you further into the dungeon,
and right takes you to a treasure chest at a dead end.  Go up and enter the
next room.

In this room, you can either go left or continue up.  Going left will only
lead you to a dead end so continue up.

In this room, there is a closed mouth, which you can whack open by using
Katt's special power.  Inside is a treasure chest.  Keep going up to continue
with the dungeon.  You'll eventually reach another closed mouth, so open it the
same way you did previously.  Continue up some more and you'll reach a long
'ghostly-figure' in dark color.  Before approaching it, make sure your
characters' HP are full, and be ready for battle.

##################
# Boss Battle 19 #
# Munmar         #
##################

Have Ryu open up casting his dragon power to knock off a good amount of damage.
Katt should attack or use HelpBLs/Herbs if needed.  Bow should cast Cure or use
items, and act as a defensive character for the most part.  Jean should attack
or cast spells.  Make sure Ryu continues to attack Munmar to keep damaging it.
If you have WFruits, use them on Ryu and have him use cast his dragon power
again to instantly defeat Munmar.  If all else  fails, put the party in the
Defense position and then Auto.  Use LifePls when ever someone dies and keep
attacking.

After defeating Munmar, it'll grow sleepy and die.  Although you've just
killed the source of what is making Grandpa sleeping, he still hasn't woken
up.  Head all the way back to the main entrance of the Whale Tunnels where
you saw that Adam's apple.  This time, activate Katt's special power to whack
it with her stick, and W.Cape begins to shake vibrantly.  Grandpa emerges
from the cape and finally awakens, spewing you out of his insides via his
wind hole pipe.  You land on the shore of W.Cape, and Grandpa offers to
take you anywhere you want.  Tree and Ton appear and tell you that you should
find a place called "Tunlan."  Before you go, however, Grandpa asks you to
get the "Whale Bell" from Maiyoru, the old man, which allows you to call
Grandpa anytime you want.  The game automatically sends you to Whale Beach.

| W.Bell*:  Talk with Maiyoru and he'll happily hand it to you.          |
o------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Enter the small cave and talk with Maiyoru.  He'll be happy that
Grandpa is all right, and gladly gives you the Whale Bell.  Now, exit the
cave and face the shoreline.  Press the A BUTTON on the Controller and you
should hear a ringing sound.  This is the Whale Bell in action, and it's
calling Grandpa.  Now you can ride Grandpa through the oceans of Breath of
Fire II.

By this point in time in the game, you should have leveled up Jean enough so
that he's learned the spell, "Warp."  Warp is one of the most useful spells
in the entire game because it can instantly warp you back to any town you've
visited.  This means that you won't have to ride Grandpa to go back to places
like Windia and TownShip.  If Jean hasn't learned Warp yet, it would be a
good idea for you to go somewhere, like near W.Cape, and level him up to LV 14
so he learns it.

Your next goal is to find the castle town called Tunlan, which Tree and Ton
mentioned earlier.  From the shore of Whale Beach, head south until bumping
into some land.  Then go east until reaching an island all by itself.  There
should be a circus, as well as a town with a shore you can park Grandpa at.  
This is where Tunlan is.  Enter the circus first, though.

### Scenario 11 - An Uparupa in Exchange for a Grassman

| 51.  Circus |

o------------------------------o

Talk to the man at the counter and he'll tell you about a Grass Man that's
about to be eaten by a demon.  Pay the 100 coins he asks you to so you can
see the event for yourself.

Keep heading up, past all the demons locked up in their cages, and talk with
the spectators along the way.  You should finally see the Grass Man locked in
a large cage with a man named "Chief" standing in front.  Talk to him.

Chief will boast about how spectacular of a show it will be when the demon
eats the Grass Man.  Chief asks you if you're looking forward to the show--
say no.  Chief then asks you if you want to stop the show--say yes.

Chief tells you that he'll only stop the show if you bring him either 900,000
Coins or an Uparupa.  Obviously, unless you're using a Game Genie or have
spent an unheard-of amount of time building up coins, you won't have enough
to pay him the 900,000 he's asking.  However, you can still save the Grass
Man if you can find an Uparupa.  Exit out of the circus by heading north and
going to the split in the left part of the screen.

Now, your next destination is the "Uparupa Cave."  Before going though, it
might be a good idea to switch up your party members.  (You can use the
dragon shrine to the right of the entrance inside Tunlan.)  Bring your two
most powerful members, and definitely put Jean in so you can warp back to
Tunlan once you're through with the Uparupa Cave.

Directions to the Uparupa Cave:  Starting from the Tunlan island, ride Grandpa
and head north (going around the island) until you bump into some land on a new
continent.  Now go east past this continent and past any islands you may see
along the way.  You will reach the first continent in the game that you
visited, and you should probably see TownShip.  Just go northeast hugging
across the edge of this continent and then go east past a mountain cave south
of you.  You should see a bridge now, and under the bridge lies a cave in the
wall against the water near the shallow water and rocks.  Enter this cave and
you will have found Uparupa Cave.

| OwlFruit:  Talk to one of the hunters and he'll sell it to you for 1000C. |
o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

From the entrance, there will be three openings you can proceed to:  one to
the left--on land, one in the middle--through water, and one to the right--
through water.  The one to the left leads you to a treasure chest, the one in
the middle is just a dead end, and the one to the right leads you further into
the cave; so enter the right opening.

In the next room, head up a bit, and you'll be able to either go up or down.  
Going down will lead you to a treasure chest, so head up into the next room.

Talk with the Uparupa Hunters and they'll provide you with some helpful
information.  Pay the 200 coins, and listen to what one of the hunters tells
you.  Also, buy the Uparupa feed (OwlFruit) from the last hunter up top for
1000 coins.  Enter the next room.

In this room, you'll notice a lot of eyes lurking in the small holes.  Each
hole has an Uparupa inside.  Find the nearest Uparupa and catch one.  
Remember what one of the hunters told you just now about how to catch an
Uparupa?  Here's how you catch an Uparupa:

To catch an Uparupa, you have to place the "feed" in front of the hole, hide,
and then wait for the Uparupa to come out.  To hide, just stand four or five
steps away from the Uparupa hiding place, and wait for it to come out.  Let
it eat the food, and immediately after it finishes, walk up to it and catch
it.  You'll now end up in a fight.  (If you messed up, waited too long, and
let the Uparupa eat the feed, skip the next boss and continue reading.)

Extremely important note:  There are two special Uparupas that can be caught.  
Please see Section 38 for a map showing you the two special ones.  If you do
not catch the two special Uparupas you will have to go through another scenario
in which you must go back and get more OwlFruits from the Owl Woods and fight a
boss.  You do not have to fight this boss at all if you decide to get the
"right" Uparupas, and you can skip to rescuing Spar immediately.  However, this
walkthrough would like to guide you through each possible scenario the game
has, so I will be assuming you do not feed the right Uparupa.  (If you do feed
the right one, skip the next few sections.)

##################
# Boss Battle 20 #
# Uparupa        #
##################

Have Ryu cast his dragon power, and have everyone else attack.  It should die
in the first round of fighting.  Be careful, it can counterattack you if you
attack it normally for some noticeable damage.  However if you cast spells on
it, it won't counterattack you.  And it will not attack you unless you attack
it first.

Unfortunately, it seems the Uparupa you just caught disappeared.  Not only
that, but you just wasted your only Uparupa feed, so you'll have to find some
more.  A place called the "Owl Woods" is said to have some feed.

Owl Woods is west of Windia.  To get there, though, you have to go through a
lodge sitting all by itself on the map.  you've probably already entered it
earlier in the game (see Section 23 in the walkthrough).  The lodge will be
locked at nighttime, so make sure you enter during the day.  Head north of the
house to reach Owl Woods.

Before going to Owl Woods, note that you will be fighting a very hard boss.
I would rank it as probably one of the top three or so bosses in the
entire game (in relation to your level).  It would be a good idea to go to
Hekkeller's shop in TownShip, and buy whatever fire equipment you can for your
party.  Then buy a couple of WFruits, which restore 20 AP, from any town's item
shop, as you'll need them to recast Ryu's dragon's powers, and finally, level
up Ryu to about LV 20.  It'd be a good idea to level up some of your other
characters, too of course.

| OwlFruit X 5:  After defeating Algernon, pick and take one from the plant. |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

As you head up, you'll hear some singing.  Pay no attention, and keep heading
up.  You'll find a girl all by herself and she'll seem happy that you came
all this way to hear her sing.  You'll now enter a fight with her and a few
of her "friends."

#################################
# Boss Battle 21                #
# Algernon, Danielle, and Suiky #
#################################

This is the hardest battle in the game so far.  Danielle will cast Cure 2 on
Algernon to help her recover 100 HP every round.  Suiky casts Thunder at the
opening of every round of combat, which knocks off a good 30 to 40 points of
damage to the entire party.  Not only that, but Algernon can do an attack which
knocks off 40 points of damage to everyone.

First, have Ryu immediately cast his dragon power to defeat both Danielle and
Suiky, and put up a good amount of damage against Algernon.  Next, have your
two slowest members (Rand should be one of them) use WFruits on Ryu.  This is
how it should work in real time:  Ryu casts his dragon powers, bringing his AP
down to 0, then the two slow members should use WFruits after Ryu uses his
dragon power, so that by the start of the next round, Ryu can cast his dragon
power at full strength.  If Danielle and Suiky don't come back to battle in the
next round of combat, use this time to cure everyone by using Cure 2 and
HelpBLs.  You shouldn't have Ryu cast his dragon powers on just Algernon, so
wait until Danielle and Suiky come back, and then cast it to kill them again.
Keep repeating this process, and eventually, you'll defeat Algernon and the
fight will be over.

Congratulations, you have just defeated one of the hardest bosses in Breath of
Fire II.

Once the fight is finished, the girl will vanish and you'll be able to grab
all the OwlFruits for yourself.  Take them all, and leave Owl Woods.  Rest up
at an inn in any of the towns by having Jean cast Warp.

Now it's time to go back to the Uparupa Cave.

With the OwlFruits you obtained from Owl Woods in hand, go back to the
Uparupa hiding places.  You've been here before, but here's a basic map of
how the room looks like, and where each hiding place is.  Study the map so
that you understand which Uparupa hiding places yield the Special Uparupas.

There are eight Uparupa hiding places.  Of all eight, only two Uparupas can
be caught.  Whenever you try catching the other six, they'll just disappear
as you have already found out earlier.  The two special Uparupas can be found
in hiding places "B" and "E."  It doesn't matter which one of the two you
decide to catch.

Simply place an OwlFruit in front of the hiding place, and catch an Uparupa
like you did before.  You'll now enter a fight with an Uparupa.

After you defeat the Uparupa, the game asks you if you will let the Uparupa
free.  If the game doesn't ask you this, then you didn't catch either of the
two Special Uparupas.

This is a very important decision you have to make.  If you say yes--let the
Uparupa free--then you will end up getting two treasure chests, which contain
a "BusterSD" and a "CharmSH."  You get the first chest after letting the
Uparupa go.  To get the second chest, you have to exit the room, and then
reenter it.  The second chest will appear exactly where the first chest was--
as if you never opened the first chest to begin with.

If you say no--keep the Uparupa--then you wind up with the special item,
"Uparupa."  This item won't benefit you in any way.

Now, you really should let the Uparupa free, and get those two treasure
chests instead.  Though you were supposed to either bring an Uparupa or
900,000 coins to the Chief--back at the Circus near Tunlan--if you go to him
without anything, then you'll still be able to progress the game the same way
you would have if you brought an Uparupa.

Pay the 100 coins and talk to Chief once more.  Now, things will be
different depending on what you just did at the Uparupa Cave.

If you let the Uparupa free, then you should see the following choices:  
Money, Uparupa, I'll give you nothing!!

If you brought either the Uparupa or the money, then these are the choices:  
Money, Uparupa, Not yet

Select "I'll give you nothing!!" if you let the Uparupa free.  If you brought
the money or the Uparupa, select that choice.  Whatever you choose, Chief
will still go back on his word, turn into a demon, and fight you.

##################
# Boss Battle 22 #
# M.C.Tusk       #
##################

Have Ryu open up casting his dragon powers.  Rand and Katt should always
attack.  Jean should attack or use curative items if someone needs it.  Be
careful, and try to end this fight as soon as possible by having your most
powerful characters continue to attack M.C. Tusk.  He will probably do an
attack that causes around 50 points of damage to the entire party, but that
shouldn't be a problem since he should be almost dead by that time.

Once you defeat M.C.Tusk, Ryu will try to open the gate for the Grass Man.  
It doesn't budge, but the Grass Man comes out another way.  The party
questions him for not getting out on his own earlier, but he says it was all
a part of his plan.  "Spar" was waiting for people like you, who could sense
that something awful was about to occur in the world.

Spar says that it might be a good idea to visit the "Great Wise Tree," which
is located in the "Big Sea of Trees" to the west of Tunlan.  Spar tells you
that you can only enter the Big Sea of Trees if he is in the party.  Make
sure you put Spar in your current party and head off.  If you're itching to
switch up your entire party altogether, then go to Tunlan, and from the
entrance, go right until finding a dragon shrine.  You should make a quick
stop to TownShip before you proceed any further with the story, however.

What could be so important for you to postpone your journey?  Now that you
have Spar in the party, you should try uniting him with a shaman.  Since he's
required to be in the party you want to make him as powerful as possible.

Here are the current shaman combinations available for Spar (just one):

Character     Shaman     Bonuses                            Appearance
=========     ======     =======                            ==========
Spar          Seso       +Wisdom +Off. +Def. +Vigor +AP     Sprite

As you can see from the table, Spar will transform into one nice character
if you unite him with the Water Shaman, Seso!  His Sprite form provides many
benefits, but perhaps the biggest is the large amount of AP you gain.  With
a Seso bonded Spar, you will most likely never have to worry about
running out of Herbs or curative items while on a long journey!

Once you're prepared, warp back to Tunlan and call Grandpa. Head west from
Tunlan until bumping into some land.  Then head north and get off Grandpa at
the shoreline.  You've been here before.  Now, from the shoreline, head west a
little more and you should see a bunch of trees all over the place.  With Spar
in the lead of the marching order, have him walk through the forest until
finding a long, skinny-like tree a little to the south.  Enter the tree.

You'll meet up with the Great Wise Tree, and Spar will try talking to it.  It
won't answer for a while but it finally responds to Spar.  The Great Wise
Tree tells you that its memory is gone and the only way to get it back is to
go to Tunlan and retrieve the "Therapy Pillow."

Tunlan is that town that was near the circus where you just got Spar, so you
shouldn't have any problems finding it.  Have Jean warp you there or go back
via Grandpa.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

As you talk to the residents in Tunlan, you'll notice that you can't
understand them.  Talk to the man near the entrance standing still, and he'll
tell you that you need a musical instrument called the "Famous Flute," from a
place called "Highfort," to understand the language of Tunlan.  
Unfortunately, he doesn't say where Highfort actually is.

Use the dragon shrine to the right of the entrance of Tunlan and switch
characters.  Make sure you add Jean and Sten to your party if they aren't
already.  Make sure you level up Sten to at least LV 17, if he isn't any
higher, since you'll need him to be as powerful as possible.  Don't worry
about buying him any powerful equipment; just level him up.

To get to Highfort, have Jean warp to TownShip.  Call Grandpa to the shoreline
south of TownShip, and move due south until spotting another shoreline.
Stop there, and you'll be on a new continent with a small house to the left.
Though you don't have to, enter the house if you wish.

Make sure you enter during the daytime because the guard won't let you pass if
it's night.  Once inside, have Sten in the lead of the marching order and
activate his special power by pressing the Y BUTTON the Controller to cross
to the other side.  As you continue, it becomes evident that Highfort is
really Sten's hometown.  Sten asks you if you really have to continue onward,
as if to say he really doesn't want to visit Highfort.  Say yes because this
is supposedly where the Famous Flute you're looking for is.  Continue, and
enter the door.

The gate guard, "Gayne," tells you that only Highlanders may enter.  However,
Gayne recognizes Sten and calls him "Chief Sten."  Sten gets a little
embarrassed by the title, and feels he doesn't deserve it because he ran away
from battle during the "Goonheim War."  Sten asks Gayne of "Trubo," whom he
believes is the real hero since he fought till the end of the war--unlike
Sten.  Gayne tells Sten that Trubo would be looking forward to seeing him
again.  Sten says that he couldn't possibly face Trubo again, for fear of
what he might say to him.  It seems something happened between Sten and Trubo
in the past.

In any event, Sten decides to leave the party and tells them to find the
Famous Flute themselves since he has his own problems.  As Sten goes down the
stairs to the lower floor, Gayne decides to allow you to stay at Highfort
since you're Sten's friends.

Now that you have control of the party, you might want to go down the stairs
and talk with Sten.  He'll say, "Please...  Ok," as if to say you should
leave him alone.  Head back up the stairs and enter the doorway to the north.  
Keep going up until reaching two guards that tell you that you'll be trouble
if you go inside the next room where the war meeting plan is being held.  
Ignore them, and continue into the next room.

You'll overhear the plans of "Shupkay," who seems to be the one in command of
Highfort.  After her commanders finish talking about the dilemma they're
facing with their troops and units, you'll show yourself to Shupkay, who
tells you that you shouldn't be in here.  The floor you're standing on
suddenly is gone, and you fall down.  The scene switches to Sten, who wonders
what's taking Ryu and company so long to get the Famous Flute.  One of the
guards asks Sten where his friends are, and Sten starts to worry and decides
to look for them himself.  The guard warns Sten to look out for Shupkay.  The
guard explains that Shupkay is the general of Highfort.

You should now be able to control Sten.  Head down the stairs you see nearby,
and you'll now be in a dungeon area where you'll have to do some battling.  
If your Sten isn't powerful enough to defeat them, just run away whenever you
get into any trouble.

Go down the next stairs and you should be in a room with three treasure
chests.  Make sure you open them all and equip Sten with the "MothDR" and
"QuickCL," as they should increase his offense and defense substantially.

Exit this dungeon area and go back upstairs where you met with Gayne,
earlier.  Buy a few HelpBLs from the item shop, and rest up at the inn.  Save
using the dragon shrine when you're all prepared.  Go into the north doorway,
and as you continue, you'll overhear Trubo talking.  Trubo, up at the top of
the tower, will spot Sten and tell him he has some nerve to come back to
Highfort.  Trubo tells Sten he has no idea what it's been like for him ever
since he ran away, and gets angry with Sten--so angry, that he decides to
drop down from the tower and fight him.

This isn't a real fight.  Have Sten use HelpBLs on himself from the beginning
of the battle so that he cures himself after Trubo attacks him.  After about
four rounds of Trubo hitting you, Trubo stops.  Sten asks Trubo if he's still
angry with him, and Trubo says yes.  Trubo tells Sten that he's angry with
him because the "princess" chose Sten over Trubo.  Trubo gets really, really,
angry and calls Sten a "fat pig!"  Not only that, but the bridge collapses
and Trubo challenges Sten to three rounds of battling as they fall down.  Get
ready; this time the fight is for real.

##################
# Boss Battle 23 #
# Torubo         #
##################

Note: Yep, Capcom renamed Trubo "Torubo" by accident.  It's a Japanese thing.

You have three rounds to defeat Torubo, and if you don't, you'll lose the fight
so there is no other option.  For starters, you might want to open up by having
Sten use a HelpBL if his HP is below 80.  Have him cast the Flame spell to do
the most damage to Torubo.  All you have to do is have Sten cast Flame twice to
win the battle--it's that easy.

After the fight is over, Sten and Trubo both fall down into the water.  Sten
takes Trubo out to land.  Trubo awakens after Sten asks how he's doing and
Trubo doesn't seem to want to fight Sten anymore.  Anyway, Trubo explains to
Sten that ever since he left, that general woman named Shupkay has been
controlling Highfort to her own liking.  Trubo further explains that Shupkay
is up to something evil, and is after the "powers" of Highfort, and that it
could involve the princess.  Sten gets worried and asks Trubo to give out the
details.  He tells Sten that there are two paths to the princess, so they
decide to split up.  Trubo will take the upper passage and Sten will take the
left passage.

Once you have control of Sten again, enter the doorway directly to your north
(the one Trubo just entered) and recover your HP and AP by drinking from the
water fountain inside.  It might be a good idea to save using the dragon
shrine, too.  Once you're done, exit and go left like you're supposed to.  
Activate Sten's special power to cross the bridge, and then head up some.

You should now be in a dungeon-like area.  Go up the stairs and you'll notice
three ways going up.  The westernmost way is just a dead end.  The middle and
easternmost ways lead to two treasure chests.  Head downright and up the two
sets of stairways to reach the next part of the dungeon.

If you're at the right place, you should be hearing some new music (which is
the music you usually hear whenever you were in a dungeon in the game).  You
can either go west or east--both ways lead to stairs.  The western stairs take
you to a treasure chest, but also a dead end.  Enter the eastern stairs to
continue with the dungeon.  Activate Sten's special power to cross the passage,
and go up the next stairs.

In this part of the dungeon, there will be four different stairways.  Three
of them lead to dead ends.  From left to right, this is how it should look
like:

o--------------------o
|  4 Stairways Map   |
|  ---------------   |
|                    |

| |_|  |_|  |_|  |_| |

|       START        |
|                    |
o--------------------o

Stairway 3 is the one you want to enter.  Go up the next flight of stairs and
enter the last doorway along the path.  Step on the red flashing tile and
you'll warp to a different part of the dungeon.  Go up the stairs and you'll
be back at the castle, this time behind everything.  Go down the stairs to
the left and step on the next red flashing tile.

You'll be transported to, yet, another part of the dungeon.  Now you should
see three different paths going north.  The west and east paths lead to
treasure chests and the middle one takes you further into the dungeon.  After
crossing the middle path, you'll see two paths you can go, west, or east.  The
western path takes you to a treasure chest.  The eastern path leads you further
into the dungeon.

You'll eventually stumble into Shupkay and the princess.  Shupkay wants the
princess to help her retrieve the "power" from the castle, but the princess
refuses.  Shupkay and the princess then notice Sten, and just like she did
before, Shupkay makes the floor Sten is standing on disappear and he falls
down.  Sten falls down exactly where the rest of the party is.  You now can
control everyone from here on out, and you realize that you must defeat
Shupkay.

Once you have control of the party, head north until reaching a grill-like
path, which appears to be a maze.  There's only one possible way you can go,
with a few dead ends along the way.  Once you reach the 2nd floor of the
maze, continue until finding a doorway.  Enter it, and drink from the water
fountain inside to recover your HP and AP from all the battling you've done
thus far.  Step on the red flashing tile to warp to a small room with a
treasure chest.  Open the treasure chest for a "MoonMask," and have Sten equip
it immediately since it should boost his defense quite a bit.  Go back outside
the doorway and go back into the maze.  Find the stairs that is going up and
enter it.  You should now reach three red flashing tiles:  one on the left, one
in the middle, and one to the right.  The left and right tiles warp you back to
areas you've already been to, so don't step on them.  The middle tile is the
one that takes you further into the dungeon.

You'll warp to a new part in the dungeon, and find Trubo.  Trubo tells you
that there's a force field on the door nearby, and, unexpectedly, Sten
punches Trubo for calling him a big shot.  Once you have control of the
party, definitely make sure Ryu has full AP and everyone else have full HP.  
Press the A BUTTON on the Controller while in front of the gate to fight a
boss called Portal.

##################
# Boss Battle 24 #
# Portal         #
##################

At first, it may seem hard, but as the battle progresses, its attack pattern
will be a bit more forgiving and it won't seem as deadly as earlier.  Have Ryu
open up by casting his dragon power, and everyone else attack.  Katt should be
the one that cures everyone by using HelpBLs, since she's the fastest.  Keep
attacking it, and it'll eventually die.  Use HelpBLs whenever you need them.
Be careful of its Typhoon spell, which will do about 70 points of damage to
each of your party members.

After defeating Portal, the force field disappears and the door explodes.  
Trubo gets back up and tells you that the control room should be destroyed.  
Talk with him again, and he'll tell you that you should go find the princess
and he'll take care of the control room.  Continue onward.

Keep going up the stairs, and ignore the red flashing tile.  When you reach
two stairways you can enter, entering the western one will lead you to two
treasure chests.  Enter the eastern stairs to continue with the dungeon.
Continue until reaching the next stairway.  Before going up, realize that
you're about to fight with Shupkay, so make sure Ryu has full AP, and everyone
has full HP.  Go up the stairs.

You'll stumble into Shupkay and the princess.  Shupkay has tied the princess
up to a weird-looking machine, and is trying to channel her energy so she can
"revive" the castle.  The princess asks Shupkay to kill her, since she would
rather die than to have anything to do with what Shupkay wants.  Sten jumps
in, and says that what she's doing isn't very lady-like.  Shupkay decides
that if she can kill Sten in front of the princess, her sadness would be all
the energy she'd need from her.  Get ready.

##################
# Boss Battle 25 #
# Shupukay       #
##################

Open up with Ryu casting his dragon power.  Everyone else should simply attack.
Keep attacking Shupukay, even when things may look dismal, because she doesn't
have too much HP.  If you don't give up, and continue to attack, you should
defeat her soon enough.  Have Katt and Jean use HelpBLs whenever needed.

After you defeat Shupukay, she threatens to use her own powers to revive the
castle, and finally you realize what her plans were--to make a flying
fortress.  Fortunately, a barrier isn't allowing Shupkay to do that.  The
scene switches to Trubo, and he keeps pounding on the control until it starts
vibrating.  The scene switches back to Shupkay and the party, and the energy
is beginning to go backwards.  Everything starts shaking and Shupkay and the
machine explode.  You barely escape and reach an elevator.  The only problem
is that you need one person to operate the elevator.  Sten opts to do it, and
asks everyone else to enter the elevator while he does all the tinkering.  
The party escapes safely and the scene switches back to the throne room in
the castle.

After everyone tells you that Sten should be all right and well, the princess
finally gives you what you were after the whole time--the Famous Flute.  The
princess asks you to tell Sten, the next time you see him, not to overdo it
and to stay safe.  Trubo decides to escort you out of the castle.  (But you
still have to control your party and get out, yourself.)

Talk with Trubo as he's standing right in front of the exit of the room with
the dragon shrine.  He'll let you all go.  As you're just about to leave
Highfort, you find Sten.  Sten and Trubo chat about what happened in the
Goonheim War, and how Sten is still alive after all that just happened.  
Trubo ends the conversation on a good note, and tells Sten that he and the
princess will be waiting for him to come back and visit.  Now, Sten won't be
afraid to come back to Highfort anymore.  Leave Highfort with the Famous
Flute in hand.

It would be a terrific idea for you to put Spar and Bow in your current party
at this point in the game.  They're both probably low on levels, compared to
everyone else, and could use some more experience.

Next stop:  Tunlan.  Look at the map by pressing the SELECT BUTTON on the
Controller, and see if you can spot where Tunlan is, in case you can't find
it.  Alternatively, you can always put Jean in the party and have him warp
there for you.

### Scenario 14 - Quest Leg 2:  To Tunlan to Cure a Queen

| Level:  23                   |

o------------------------------o

Now that you have the Famous Flute, talk with all the residents.  You'll
understand that the queen is quite sick, but most of the people don't have
much sympathy for her since she's so mean.  Check inside the castle and go to
the top floor.  Talk to the two Tunlan residents standing next to the queen,
and they'll tell you about someone named "Old Man Gedd."  It seems like this
"Gedd" person is the only one who can save the queen.  The problem is, that
the queen banished Gedd for being so cruel to women, and sent him to a small
island.  Your goal, now, is to find Gedd so he can help you save the queen.

Before heading off, check out the armory in town and buy some equipment for
Spar and Bow.  They both probably have some outdated equipment by this
point in the game.

Gedd can be found in a mountain called "Mt.Maori."  Mt.Maori is located
on a lone island (about the same size as the island Tunlan is located on)
northeast of Tunlan.  If you're having trouble finding it, warp to HomeTown,
and it's just a tad north of it.  Make sure you bring at least one female
with you--Nina, Katt, or a Seso-bonded Spar (Sprite).  A normal Spar
doesn't count as a female.

o------------------------------o

Once inside, enter the cave opening.  You should see some clear water you can
drink from to regain your HP and AP.  Take this opportunity and bring your
weakest characters--which, are probably Spar, Nina, and Bow--and build up a
couple levels for them so that their levels are within a respectable range of
some of your more powerful characters.  To make the battles a whole lot easier,
just have Ryu cast his dragon power, and then keep restoring your AP from the
clear water after every battle.

Once you're through with that, enter the next room.  Approach the old man
standing in the middle of the room and he'll say that he'll only talk to
"pretty girls."  This old man is actually Gedd--the old man you've been
looking for.  To get Gedd to talk some more, you have to have a female
character in the lead of the marching order and then talk to him, or else
he'll just continue to say the same thing repeatedly.

You explain to Gedd that you need his help to save the queen of Tunlan
(although he says "princess," it may be an error on the game's part).  Gedd
first backs off, and remembers that he got fired by the queen.  However, Gedd
decides to help the queen only if one of your female members kisses him.  If
you brought Katt, she'll just pound Gedd with her stick until it hurts.  If
you brought Nina, she'll blush and Gedd will feel guilty for asking for a
kiss.  Gedd now joins your party, but technically, he can't fight with you or
show himself while he walks with you.  Head back to Tunlan.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Enter the queen's room inside the castle.  As you enter her room, "Granny"
will begin to worry about the queen dearly.  Gedd and Granny begin to bicker
a little, and decide to call a truce for the queen's sake.  Gedd examines the
queen and realizes that she could be changing into a demon.  Gedd asks for
your help, and gives you a "Letter" to give to one of his assistants back at
Mt.Maori.  He needs special "equipment" which can only be found there.  
The equipment he needs is listed in the letter.

Before heading back to Mt.Maori, make sure you switch up your party
members at the nearest dragon shrine.  You must bring Sten with you for this
trip because you'll need his long arms to help you climb the mountain.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Head back into the room where you first found Gedd, and you'll find his
"assistant" hopping in the middle of the room.  Approach him, and you'll hand
him the Letter you just got.  He'll tell you to go to the top of the mountain
and find a special type of "mushroom" that he shows you.

Get back to the outside area of the mountain, and put Sten in the lead of the
marching order.  Have him use his long arms to help you grab on to the stakes
by activating his special power.  Go east and you'll find a cave opening as
well as a stairway leading up with some more stakes to grab onto, heading
east.  The next set of stakes lead you to a dead end with a treasure chest at
the end.  Enter the opening.

Head up the next set of stairways, getting the treasure chests along the way,
and then go right into the next opening.

You should now be outside, with a beautiful looking waterfall flowing.  
Activate Sten's special power to grab onto the stake to get to the other side.  
Enter the opening to the right.

You should now be back inside the mountain.  Enter the opening directly above
you for a treasure chest, if you like.  Get back to the main room, and continue
north.  If you go left, you'll enter an exit that takes you back outside of the
mountain, but behind the waterfall.  You'll be on a ledge.  Head as far left
as you can on the ledge, and then push down on the CONTROL PAD.  You should
fall down to another ledge with a treasure chest.  Fall down once more to get
back to where you were earlier.

Get back to the main room, and continue going up the stairways.  There's a
treasure chest on the right side, and a cave opening you can enter on the left
side.  Enter the opening and get the treasure chest all the way to the right.
Exit the opening, and you should be able to continue left.  Enter this opening
and you'll be outside the mountain, and at the very top.  Here's a Map:

|        Get Mushroom "c"--ignore the others!        |                         
o----------------------------------------------------o

Ignore all the other mushrooms except the ones noted on the map (a, b, and
c).  While all three mushrooms are very similar, only one is the right
mushroom you need to bring to the assistant.  Activate Sten's special power to
grab onto the stake to reach the three mushrooms.  The mushroom you need to
pick is mushroom "c," the one farthest to the right on the small peninsula.

If you grab the wrong mushroom, the game automatically sends you back to the
assistant, and you have to go all the way back to the top and get the right
one; so don't mess up!

Once you grab the right mushroom, the game sends you back to the assistant.  
The assistant gives you the equipment you need inside a treasure box that
drops out of nowhere.  Open it to get a "Mirror."

Exit Mt.Maori, and head back to Tunlan with the Mirror in hand.

Switch party members (Rand, Nina, Spar, and Ryu is a good party to have) at the
dragon shrine if you want to, go back to the queen's room, and talk to Gedd.  
He'll explain to you that you need to enter the queen's body and destroy the
"Fatty" inside.  Gedd shrinks you with the mushroom you got earlier, and then
uses his magic to warp you into her body.

o-------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Anytime you want to leave the queen's body, simply use the Mirror (which is
located in your Regular Item list in the Status Screen) and the game will
give you three choices:  "look," "go," and "not use it."  Look allows you to
listen to what Gedd says while you're still inside the queen's body.  Go lets
you leave the queen's body, and not use it just cancels everything.

You start in the upper right section of the queen's body.  Your goal, just
like what Gedd said earlier, is to defeat the entire Fatty (a.k.a. monsters)
inside her majesty.  In other words, you'll have to defeat all the monsters
inside the queen's body.  To do this, you have to fight battles in every room
in here.  Check the Status Screen, and then look at the Monster Meter to see if
there are monsters still left in the room.  If there are, the Monster Meter
will be active.  If not, it will be sleeping.

There are four sections inside the queen's body:  northeast, southeast,
southwest, and northwest.  That's also the exact order you should clear each
section in.

Here's how many battles you should fight in each section to clear the section
completely:

o-----------------------o
| # Of Battles Required |
|    For Each Section   |
| --------------------- |
| Northeast = 8 battles |
| Southeast = 5 battles |
| Southwest = 6 battles |
| Northwest = 8 battles |
o-----------------------o

You really should have brought along someone who can help cure your party if
you need it.  A Seso-bonded Spar (Sprite) would be the perfect example.  She
has a ton of AP as well as Cure 1.  Rand would be a good person to bring,
too.  Anyhow, the battles should be unbelievably easy.

Once you're through purging the queen's body, Gedd will transport you out.  
Gedd and everyone else will thank you for your heroics because you prevented
the queen from turning into a demon.  Granny asks Gedd if he could stay at
Tunlan and help the queen recover.  Gedd then thanks you for bringing him
back to Tunlan.  Now you'll need to get the Therapy Pillow; it's inside a
specially guarded treasure chest you may have seen earlier in the castle.

Once you have control of your party, you'll need to find the treasure chest.
Go down the stairs, and then down the next set of stairs.  Now, go left, go
through the two doorways, and talk with the Tunlanian standing by herself.
She'll give you the Therapy Pillow, herself.  Remember, you were supposed to
find the Therapy Pillow so you could enter the Great Wise Tree's Dream.

Exit Tunlan.  It might be a good idea to warp back to TownShip, regroup, and
save.  Make sure you put in Spar in the current party if he isn't already.  
One couldn't recommend enough just how beneficial it is to have a Seso-bonded
Spar (Sprite) with you due to her large pool of AP and useful spells.  Once
you've finished deciding who else you'll bring, and what shamans you'll fuse
with whom, warp back to SimaFort so you can get to the Great Wise Tree quicker.
Just head south until coming into some trees, and then put Spar in the lead of
the marching order so he can walk through them.  Enter the noticeably big tree.

### Scenario 15 - Quest Leg 3:  Dream World

o------------------------------o

You'll now appear in a new world, which is called "Dream."  There are three
different towns in this world.  All three towns look identical to each other,
except for the roofs of the houses, which differ from town to town.  Each
town has an inn, a dragon shrine, and a shop.  (It varies from town to town
what each shop sells.  Also, you can't sleep in two of the towns' "inns.")

Obviously, each town has different people residing in it.  The first of the
three towns has old men.  The second has middle-aged men, and the last of the
three has young children.  Finally, all three towns have the same name:  
"Inheart."  To differentiate between towns, I have put what kind of residents
live in each town.  For instance, "Inheart (old)" means the town where only
old men reside in.

First things first, enter the town directly to your left.

                                       *

o------------------------------o

There is absolutely nothing important to do in this town.  Talk with the old
men for some information.  One of the old men will talk about a placed called
"Memory Tower."  Although you can't rest at the inn, you can enter the shop
and buy some equipment, if you have the coins.  Leave Inheart (old), and head
east to the next town, "Inheart (middle-aged)."

                                       *

o------------------------------o

You can rest at the inn here if you want.  Other than that, there's nothing
else you can do here except talk with the residents and learn about the
"Dragon Clan," "Demon," and the "Legend."  Leave Inheart (middle-aged), and
head north to the last town, "Inheart (young)."

                                       *

o------------------------------o

Enter the inn and talk with the old man inside.  "Barose" will offer to teach
you magic if you give him a place to stay in TownShip.  If you want to have
some of your characters learn some spells, say yes to him.  Anyway, this is
now or never; you can't go back and get Barose after you complete Dream so
you'll have to make a decision.

(Barose is widely considered to be the best tenant for House 4, so if you are
undecided, I would definitely recommend you pick him up.  He'll teach you
one of the most powerful spells in the game once you recruit him.)

Enter the shop, and you can buy some items to your left.  To your right, talk
with the young child and he can take you outside Gandaroof's mind and back to
the real world.  You probably won't need to, though, since you should be
prepared enough to continue.

Make sure you talk with everyone in this town--more importantly, the child
that is north of the inn who says, "Did you find the tower?  I believe you
can see it from the lake in the west."

Leave Inheart (young), and this time, go back to the very first town:  
Inheart (old).

o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Looks like things have changed.  What's that?  You say you still see a normal
looking town?  Then, you didn't talk to the child in Inheart (young) just
mentioned earlier.  Once you talk to the child, you trigger Inheart (old)
into turning into Memory Tower.

It looks like you're inside of Grandpa, or the queen of Tunlan, judging by
the surroundings.  It also seems you can't see things close to you, but only
far away from you.  This dungeon happens to be one of the most confusing in
the entire game.

From the 1st floor, talk with the old man nearby if you want, but head north
(feel your way up) and talk to the old man up there.  He'll offer to escort
you to the "entrance" for 100 coins.  Don't say no to him, or else he'll
charge 1000 coins next time you ask.  Say yes, and you'll still be in the
same room, but in the center.  Now, see those two chests directly north of
you?  If you want them, you have to talk to the old man again and say yes
when he asks you if he can escort you to the "exit."  Now you'll appear next
to those two chests; feel free to open them.  Don't talk to the old man until
you get the chests, or you won't have a chance to open them since he'll send
you outside of Memory.

Go back inside Memory and talk to the old man near the north end of the room
once again, and agree to pay him those 100 coins to take you to the
"entrance."  Now, instead of paying him another 100 coins to take you to the
"exit," move one step right and then one step up to find a stairway leading
you to the next floor.

From the 2nd floor, head up the stairways going up, which is just a step or
two south of where you entered the floor.  Ignore the old man at the eastern
end of the room, as he'll escort you to the 4th floor, and past the 3rd floor
which has a treasure chest.

From the 3rd floor, head south and then west for a chest.  Continue west,
feeling your way through the walls, and then north into the next set of
stairs leading to the 4th floor.

From the 4th floor, head up the stairways going up, which is just a step or
two south of where you entered the floor.  (This small room should look
identical to the 2nd floor.)

From the 5th floor, go south and north for two chests.  Head east, and then
south, a little, for another chest.  There are three chests on this floor in
case you lost count.  Anyway, this floor has the potential to be a little
confusing.  Just know that the goal is to head northeast, by feeling your way
through the walls, and up the next stairway.

From the 6th floor, head up the stairways going up, which is just a step or
two south of where you entered the floor.  (This room should look identical
to the 2nd and 4th floors.)

From the 7th floor, head west a little, then north into the next room.  
Ignore the old men in the room.  Once you enter the next room, talk with the
old man standing by himself.  He'll tell you that he wants to destroy
Gandaroof's mind, because Gandaroof knows something that is of inconvenience
to his "God."  Not only that, but the old man tells you that he was the one
that destroyed everyone's memory back in Gate when Ryu was just a kid after
Ryu came back from BushLnd.  The old man turns into a demon called
"Aruhameru."  Aruhameru now wants to kill you.  What a surprise; get ready.

##################
# Boss Battle 26 #
# Aruhamel       #
##################

Note:  Capcom translated Aruhameru's name differently.  Once again this is a
Japanese to English translation error.

Have Ryu open up by casting his dragon power to knock off those reliable 512
points of damage.  Spar should always attack since none of his spells are
effective against Aruhamel.  The same goes for Bow.  Jean should attack or use
items.  This should be a relatively easy fight, but if you're having problems
with Aruhamel, use the "Scramble" formation so you can put your more offensive
characters in the front of the formation, and have your weakest character in
the back to help cure when needed.

Aruhamel will blow up and you'll be free to move your party.  You might be
wondering what you're supposed to do right now.  Well, if you want, you can go
back to the old men in the previous room and talk to them for some more
information about the "God" Aruhamel was referring to, as well as some other
stuff.  Spar should definitely know the spell, "Exit," by now so have him cast
that and get you out of here.

Back in the world of Dream, head north to the town of Inheart (young).

Enter the shop inside, and talk to the child on the right counter.  He'll ask

You will now be back at the Great Wise Tree, and Gandaroof will thank you.  
Put Spar in the lead of the marching order, if he isn't already, and talk to
Gandaroof.  He'll ask you if you have any questions, and the game will give
you four choices.  Ask about "Green," and Gandaroof will talk about some
people who can fight the demon that live south of here.  Looks like that's
where you should be heading.

Exit the Great Wise Tree, head south through the forest, and past a bridge to
enter "Fog Valley."

Just at its name would suggest Fog Valley is indeed quite hazy.  Talk with
the man standing near you, and he'll tell you that it would be impossible to
cross the valley as it is right now.  He mentions a place called "Sky Tower,"
which may be the cause of the inclement weather.

Sky Tower, contrary to what the name suggests, can be found in the ocean.  
It's north of Tunlan, and it's very small (it takes up one square on the
map).  Go inside when you find it.  (If you're having trouble finding it,
warp to Capitan and head south to the shoreline.  Call Grandpa, and just head
south; you'll see it, for sure.)

From the entrance, head down the stairway.  Talk to the fish merchant
standing still in front of the open hole.  He'll assume you want to check out
what's going on since you've asked about the fog problems.  Talk to the fish
merchant again, and he'll ask if you want to check things out.  Say, yes.

You'll drop down via the rope and be submerged underwater.  If you want to
exit, you can do so by pressing the A BUTTON on the Controller in front of the
rope.  There should be a timer ticking automatically, starting from the 3-
minute mark, which is the amount of time you can stay underwater without
choking.  There are various rooms in the Sky Tower where you can breathe in,
so you'll have to find them so you won't die--which will happen if the timer
expires at 00:00.  The timer will tick even during battles, but not while
you're using the Status Screen.  Every time you enter a room with air in it
(you'll know it because you're no longer underwater), the timer will reset
back to 3:00, thus allowing you to explore deeper into Sky Tower.

From the first room, you can either go east or west.

If you go east, you can buy some very good (yet expensive) equipment from
one of the fish merchants in one of the rooms ahead.  Observe that in the room
where you can buy equipment, you can safely breathe.  If you continue right,
past the fish merchant, you'll be able to find two treasure chests, which
contain a very powerful sword called "GoblinSD," and some relatively good
armor.  You definitely need to pick up the GoblinSD, as it should increase
Ryu's offense by a whole lot (30 points).  The catch, though, is that you only
have a very limited time to get it since you're underwater the whole time.
Have Ryu cast Smoke or use Smoke items so you don't encounter too many battles.
Try to run away if you can, too.  After the two treasure chests, there is a
dead end, and you'll have to go back to the very first room, so use your time
management skills to plan accordingly for the trip back.

If you go west, you will go further into the dungeon.  After going west, you
can either go north or south.  In the southern room, you can find a treasure
chest.  In the northern room, you can find a stairway leading up onto the next
floor.

After going up the stairway, you'll be in one of the rooms mentioned earlier
where you can breathe.  Go south into the next room and you'll be back
underwater.  Continue, and you'll spot a treasure chest along the way.  Go
north into the next room, then up the next stairway, and onto the next floor.

After going up the 2nd stairway, you'll be back into another breathing room.  
Go north into the next room.  Head west into another room.  You should now see
some water streams flowing in different directions.  Your goal is to get to
the stairway.  Although you can go into another room to the west, there's
absolutely nothing inside.  Go up this stairway to reach the next floor.

After going up the 3rd stairway, you'll still be underwater, but you should
see three treasure chests on this floor.  Go up the next stairway to reach the
next floor.

This floor looks identical to the previous floor except there aren't any
treasure chests.  You can go through the skinny wall between both stairways to
get to the next stairway faster.  Go up the next stairway to reach the top of
Sky Tower.

You should now be in a breathing room.  Talk to the girl wandering around on
the center platform of this room.  "Spoor" tells you that she's sorry for
blowing fog; you learn she only did it because she was bored.  You then learn
that Spoor is the Wind Shaman.  She then decides to go back to Granny in Town
Ship.  Now you have the Wind Shaman available for you to unite with.  If you
have Spar or Nina in your current party, cast Exit to leave the Sky Tower.  
(You can only cast Exit in breathing rooms--not underwater.)

After leaving the Sky Tower, head to TownShip now that you have the ability
to unite with the Wind Shaman, Spoor.

Now would be a good time to go back to Granny and try out some combinations
with the Wind Shaman.

Here are the new combinations available to you with the Wind Shaman, Spoor:

Character     Shaman(s)         Bonuses                            Appearance
=========     =========         =======                            ==========
Bow           Spoor                                 +Vigor         -
Rand          Spoor                                 +Vigor         -
Rand          Sana & Spoor              +Off.       +Vigor         -
Rand          Seso & Spoor      +Wisdom             +Vigor         -
Nina          Spoor                                 +Vigor         Green
Nina          Sana & Spoor              +Off.       +Vigor         Green
Nina          Seso & Spoor      +Wisdom             +Vigor         Green
Sten          Spoor                                 +Vigor         -
Sten          Sana & Spoor      +Wisdom +Off. +Def. +Vigor +AP     Warrior
Sten          Seso & Spoor      +Wisdom             +Vigor         -
Jean          Spoor                                 +Vigor         -
Jean          Seso & Spoor      +Wisdom             +Vigor         -
Spar          Seso & Spoor      +Wisdom +Off. +Def. +Vigor +AP     Sprite

For the first time in the game, you can unite two shamans with one character!
Try some combinations out and see if it's to your liking.  Unfortunately, Katt
still cannot unite with any shamans at this point in the game.  As you can
see, Sten can transform himself quite nicely by having him unite with Sana and
Spoor.  You can also keep a Seso Spar and, thus, have two powerful shaman-
bonded characters simultaneously.  Definitely take advantage of this (unless
you just can't stand Sten of course).

Since you've made the trip here, you might as well check in with Barose in
one of the houses.  If you didn't get Barose while in the Dream world, then
skip the rest of this section.  The old man Barose is in House 4, which should
be one of the houses in the newly constructed set of three that you had the
carpenter make for you after you filled the first three houses.

Barose has the ability to teach any of your party members any of the
following spells:  "Thunder," "Freeze," "Flame," and "Missile."  Depending on
your Dragon Meter, he can teach any of your party members a spell four times
meaning you can have one particular character learn all four spells, or have
four different characters learn one spell, or have two characters learn two
spells (and so forth).  What you decide is up to you, but here's some more
in-depth information to help make the best possible decision.

Here is a little chart on each spell:

Spell       What It Does               Range      Ranking (Damage Dealt)
=====       ============               =====      ======================     
Thunder     Thunder Arrow              All        D
Freeze      Freezing Snowstorm         Single     C
Flame       Triangle Flame Pyramid     All        B
Missile     Atmospheric Explosion      All        A+

Missile is definitely the best spell of the four since it seems to do the
most damage.  You can definitely wreck some havoc if you give it to the right
people.  I would personally recommend just going with Missile and teaching it
to four of your favorite characters, but the choice is yours.  Now that you
know what spell(s) you'll want to learn, the only question that remains is
which characters should learn them?

Before we waste our precious opportunity here hastily and without some thought,
we may want to first take a step back and examine if any of the characters
happen to learn any of the four spells naturally (by leveling up). Let's look
at the following table:

Character  Barose Spells Learned Naturally
=========  ===============================
Ryu        None
Bow        None
Rand       Thunder (LV 9)
Katt       None
Nina       Thunder, Flame (LV 20), Freeze (LV 24), and Missile (LV 57)
Sten       Flame (LV 15) and Missile (LV 38)
Jean:      None
Spar:      Freeze (LV 28)

Nina, Spar, and Bow are the best choices for Missile.  Jean, Sten, and Rand
are well-rounded choices, but Ryu and Katt are bad choices.  You don't want
to teach Ryu any of the spells because he already has dragon powers, and Katt
doesn't even have that much AP to continually be able to cast them without
refreshing her AP constantly with WFruits.

Now, if you are going for a perfect file, you don't want to teach Nina
or Sten Missile.  But very few people will truly bother trying to get their
characters to maximum LVs and maximum statistics.  That's why I would still
teach Nina and Sten Missile for the vast majority people following this guide.

To get Barose to teach you a spell, the character you want to learn it has to
have extremely low HP and AP.  For some reason or another, Barose wants you
to be extremely weak when he teaches you magic.  Get the desired character(s)
you want to learn the spells at precisely the following HP and AP values:  1
HP and 0 AP.

To get a character to 0 AP, just enter a battle and keep casting a spell that
will bring you all the way down to 0 AP; pay attention to what the spell you
keep casting costs, so that you get exactly down to 0, and not 1 or 2.

To get a character to 1 HP, all you have to do is enter a battle, kill the
character off so they have 0 HP, and then go to a dragon shrine.  Choose the
"Change" option to change your party members and the character with 0 HP will
automatically be revived and start with 1 HP.

Now that the hard part is out of the way, here's how to get the spell you
want Barose to teach you.  Notice the Dragon Meter whenever talking to
Barose?  That is very important, so remember the color at all times.  The
color will change every time you answer any of Barose's questions.

Here's how the dialogue should be like:

Barose Q & A Dialogue
=====================
Barose:  Are you a person with little AP?
You:     Yes
Barose:  Umm, umm.  I'm very impressed.  It's completely empty.
Barose:  By the way ... are you a person with little HP?
You:     Yes
Barose:  Oh, very good.  You have no energy left.  Shall I teach (your
character's name here) the magic?
You:     Yes
Barose:  All right.  I'm going to teach (your character's name here) the
(Thunder, Flame, Freeze, Missile) magic.
Barose:  Can I really teach this to (your character's name here)?
You:     Yes (or say No if you don't want the spell)

About the Dragon Meter:  the worst Dragon Meter you can have is dark purple.  
The best Dragon Meter is flashing colors.  To get to the worst Dragon Meter,
simply have a character with full AP talk to Barose and answer yes when he
asks if you're a person with little AP.  To get to the best Dragon Meter,
keep answering yes to Barose's questions with a character with 1 HP and 0 AP.  
Say no when he asks if he can teach the magic to your character, and then
continue to repeat the process until the meter flashes colors.

If Barose wants to teach you a spell you don't want, continue to say No every
time he asks, "Can I really teach this to (your character's name here)?"  
Eventually, the spell you want will be offered.  Now, a last minute tip about
the Dragon Meter: anytime you see it flashing a variety of colors rapidly,
this means that Barose will offer you the spell, Missile.

Once you're through learning the spells from Barose, make sure you put Jean
in your current party if he isn't already, and head back to Fog Valley.  
Remember, it's south of where the Great Wise Tree is, and passed the bridge.

o------------------------------o

There's absolutely nothing to do here except to pass through.  The enemy
encounter rate will be a tad on the high side, so you may want to use a Smoke
item/spell.  Keep heading south (going east just leads to a dead end) and
exit Fog Valley.

Back on the map, head a little west, then go north and you should see a tree
similar to the Great Wise Tree; enter it.  You'll need Jean to get there by
activating his special power to turn into a gigantic frog.

(Although there isn't any real need to visit the "Wise Tree," the tree spirit
there gives you a helpful tip for later on in the game.  You always have the
option of skipping the next section though since it's not required to hear
the tip.)

Put Spar in the lead of the marching order and talk to the tree spirit.  
He'll tell you to be generous with your contributions in "Namanda."  For now,
just keep that in the back of your head.  There's nothing else left to do
here, so exit.

Head back east, where you exited Fog Valley, then head south and enter the
village, "Farm Town."

It looks like most of the residents here resemble Rand.  Talk with everyone,
and you'll learn about "St. Namanda," and how praying is important to these
people so that the harvest will grow.  Enter the north-center home, and a scene
takes place.  A person gets kicked out of "Daisy's" house for wanting to build
a church on her grounds.

Put Rand in your current party via the dragon shrine in town, and put him in
the lead of the marching order.  Talk with everyone in town, and it becomes
apparent that this is Rand's hometown.  Enter Daisy's house again, and you'll
be able to explore it.  Enter the room in the middle and you'll automatically
meet Daisy--well, sort of.  She smacks Rand around for leaving her, and then
you learn that Daisy is Rand's mother!  Daisy gets a tad emotional and
orders Rand and the party to plow the fields.

The next morning, you have to begin your task and plow the fields.  Once you
leave Daisy's house, head up onto the field and press the A BUTTON on the
Controller in front of each bush, tree stump, and stone you see.  You'll
enter a battle with each and you'll have to destroy them all.  This is
actually fun since they don't fight back.  However, the last stone won't be
such a pushover.  Get ready for this boss.

##################
# Boss Battle 27 #
# S.Golem        #
##################

S.Golem keeps defending until he unleashes a giant killer of an attack called
"Fireball" which does 100+ points of damage to each member in your party.  
Have Ryu cast his dragon powers and everyone else attack.  If Bow knows the
spell Def-UpX by now, definitely have him cast that for some added defense.  
If you need curing, use HelpBLs.  Keep attacking and the fight will be over
soon.

After defeating S.Golem, head back inside Daisy's house and put Rand in the
lead of the marching order if he isn't already.  Talk to Daisy and she asks
you to rest for the night.  Once you wake up, Rand apologizes for making the
rest of the party help him do the work.  Go back out to the field and talk to
Daisy.  She'll tell you to go to a place called "Namanda" and pray for a good
harvest.

Namanda can be found just a little west of Farm Town.  It looks like a
smaller version of a regular looking cave.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Enter the tree house at the entrance and talk to the man inside.  He'll tell
you who Namanda actually is:  the God of Earth and Crops.  Exit the tree
house and continue north.  Talk with the man standing by himself at the top
of the short set of stairs, and he'll let you in since you wish to pray for a
good harvest.  Continue into the next room.

You should now be in a small room with some torches.  Continue into the next
room through the doorway.

Be careful; in this room, you'll encounter some enemies.  Head up and you'll
spot a man fighting off a monster.  Talk to him if you want.  Anyway,
continue north into the next room.

Observe the surroundings and talk with everyone in here.  The two men in
front of the bells will play a song.  You can talk with the man lying on top
of the spikes in the north part of the room if you want.  Exit this room when
you're ready, but remember where it is as you'll be coming back here a little
later if you want to learn a secret spell.

Once you're back outside (with the man and the monster fighting), continue
north into the last room.  Once inside, you'll spot a box in the center of
the room.  Step in front of it, press the A BUTTON on the Controller, and
the game will ask if you wish to donate 100 coins.  Although you really need
to just donate once to progress further into the game, if you donate 20 (t-w-
e-n-t-y) times, you'll be able to obtain the Earth Shaman later in the game.  
Don't pass this opportunity up, as the Earth Shaman can definitely be of
value to you.  2,000 coins is only about 1/4 of what some weapons in the game
cost you.  Note:  you have a limited opportunity to donate the coins.  If you
wait too long to donate, you will never be able to get the Earth Shaman.  After
you've donated, exit Namanda.

The next place you should go to is Farm Town, however, you must strengthen
your characters--more importantly, Rand--before going back there.

By this point in the game, unless you've leveled up a lot, you're probably
not overstocked in terms of items and money, and will need to level up your
party.  Put it this way:  if most of your characters are under LV 30, then
definitely don't skip these next few sections.

You need to update Rand's equipment and level him up a bit at this point in
the game, since you'll need him at full strength later on.  Now is a good
time to head to the town of "Guntz."

Guntz is directly south of where Tunlan is.  Warp to Tunlan, and ride Grandpa
from the shoreline just a little south until spotting a large island with a
shoreline, which is a little to the east, ready for you to park Grandpa at.  
You should also see a Wise Tree right at the entrance of the island (it looks
just like the Great Wise Tree you entered earlier in the game), which you can
enter, but for now, head west and enter Guntz.  Guntz looks like a fortress
on the world map.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Guntz is nothing more than a small town with some shops.  Enter the armory
and buy Rand a "BlindedSH."  This should greatly improve his defense.  Now
might be a good time to refresh your items at the item shop.  Make sure you
have a good supply (at least 9 of each) of WFruits and HelpBLs.  You can
explore what's left of Guntz, but as you've probably found out by now, it's a
very small town.  An important NPC named Eichichi--whom you'll be meeting
later--is located in the last house of the town, so keep this in the back of
your mind for later when you need to come back here.

For now, though, you've got some other things to think about--like leveling
up characters.  A great place to level up Rand (and everyone else) is to
fight the enemies located on a lone island all the way at the northern middle
part of the world of Breath of Fire II.  Before attempting to locate
the island, switch up your characters at the dragon shrine.  Bring your
lowest leveled character and make sure you bring Rand with you.  Also, bring
Bow, as he is vital for killing the enemies on the island.

To find the island, sail directly due south of Guntz.  You'll spot a very
large island halfway through, so ignore it.  You'll eventually see a house on
a small island.  This is "Monster Island."  Enter the house when you arrive.

Note:  You can find a fishing spot on the north part of the isle.  If you
fish from there, you can find a LoveBR, which will help recover your health
for each step you take, so bring a rod and some bait if you're feeling lucky.

Enter the hut.  Hmm... what do we have here?  These two characters should look
familiar to you.  (At the risk of avoiding spoilers, the author will refrain
from telling you these two individuals' origins.)  The fox says a particularly
interesting line:

"I was plowing this land and found a shining rock...When you hold the rock in
your hands, you can see the bones...Isn't it strange?"

Now, what could he be hinting at?

Anyway, exit the house when you're done.  Monster Island features some very
large enemies that may look familiar.  They shouldn't be too hard to defeat;
that is, if you brought Bow along.  Use Bow's Special Combat Ability, "Shot,"
against some of the enemies on the island because it can instantly defeat most
of them in one hit.  The catch?  It doesn't work all the time, so if it hits
for just one point of damage, keep trying until it connects for some real
damage.

If you encounter a Chorking, try casting ChopChop (assuming you got it from
WildCat) instead of relying on Bow's Shot.  But perhaps the easiest way to
defeat the Chorking is by using a Frizbee item against it, which you can buy
from Guntz.

The A.Sludge enemy (giant sludge) are easily taken care of via Bow's Shot and
the Death spell.

If you encounter a GongHead you may want to just run away.  It's not an easy
enemy to kill but sometimes Bow's Shot and the Death spell will work against
it.
Take note:  there is a dangerous enemy called K.Sludge on the island that
appears every so often.  It's the only small monster and they can appear in up
to groups of three.  If you encounter one, you are probably best running away
unless you are very well off in terms of levels because Bow's Shot won't be
effective against them.

Once you've gotten your party to an average of about LV 30, leave Monster
Island and warp back to Farm Town.

Go back to Daisy's field (where you plowed earlier).  A messenger (who looks
like a man in heavy armor) will be there.  If you still see Daisy, then you
didn't donate any coins in Namanda--go back there and make a donation to
trigger the messenger appearing in Farm Town.

Put Rand in the lead of the marching order and talk to the messenger.  He'll
show you a letter that Daisy "wrote."  She writes that she has agreed to let
the "Eva Church" be built on her property, and that she's left to the "Grand
Church."  It surely looks like Daisy's writing to her son, Rand, but Rand
questions the messenger and doesn't believe him.  Rand gets so enraged and
decides to fight the messenger, one-on-one combat style.

##################
# Boss Battle 28 #
# Paladin        #
##################

Have Rand continue to attack Paladin.  Whenever Rand's HP drops to 120 or
less, have him cast Cure 2 or use HelpBLs and Extracts to recover some much-
needed HP.  If Rand is getting defeated easily, you need to level him up some
more at Monster Island.  Be patient, and play it safe with this battle.

After you defeat Paladin, Ray--the person generous enough to grant you a
spell back when you saved the children in Capitan--will come and warn the
party.  Ray tells Rand that Daisy really did become a believer, but Rand
doesn't buy it and gets real angry.  Ray says that he hopes that he and Rand
will "understand each other," and takes off.  Rand then asks the rest of the
party if they think that the Eva Church people took Daisy by force.  Saying
no will only affect the Dragon Meter for the worse, so just say, yes and
agree with Rand on this one--he is your friend after all and you should trust
his instincts.

Rand says that he thinks the "St.Eva Church" is responsible for all of this.  
Rand then mentions that flying would be an easy way to find the church.

Exit through Daisy's house and talk with all the residents in town.  One of
the women inside one of the houses says that you can't enter St.Eva Church by
sea since it's located on a cliff.  She says that if you were to fly, you
would surely be able to reach the church.  Exit Farm Town.

Outside, you should now hear some new map music, which signals a new chapter
of Breath of Fire II.  Before continuing with your quest there are a couple
of optional tasks you need to complete.  If you go back to Namanda, you can
learn a secret spell.  However, be warned that getting this spell requires
extreme patience and luck.

Remember where the room with the two men who rang the bells was?  If you
enter it now, you'll see that there is only one man on the left side.  He
asks you if you can play the "Prayer Song" by pressing the "red" and "yellow"
buttons.  The game messed up in this instance, because on the SNES Controller,
there aren't any of those colors on the buttons.  The reason is because
the Super Famicom (Japanese version of the Super Nintendo) Controller had
those colored buttons, and the translators forgot to change it for the SNES
Controller, which has light and dark purple colored buttons.  Anyway,
the two buttons you have to press are the A and B BUTTONs on the Controller,
so concentrate your fingers on those two buttons alone.

Here is a diagram to how to play the Prayer Song (when you need to press the
buttons):

o----------------------------------o
|       Prayer Song Solution       |
|       --------------------       |
|                                  |

| -A-B-- A-B-A-- B---B--AB----A  A |
| 12341234123412341234123412341234 |
|                                  |
| - = His notes                    |
|   = A pause (Blank)              |
| 0 = Your gong notes (A)          |
| + = Your high notes (B)          |
o----------------------------------o

Prayer Song Tip:
For players who have trouble keeping the rhythm, it might be helpful to
constantly tap your foot at the pace of the notes, so you leave appropriate
time for the pauses.  If you are still having trouble, you can try numbering
each of the 32 "characters" (spaces included) in the melody and then count in
your head as you tap your foot.

The man will first play the Prayer Song for you so you can hear it and try to
memorize it, and then he asks you to play along with him.  This is definitely
not easy.  If you can play the Prayer Song properly, you'll be able to learn
a secret spell called "Boombada," which will knock half of all monsters' HP
during battle.  Boombada uses monsters' susceptibility, and therefore it
doesn't work on several monsters and bosses.

After you've succeeded (or failed) playing the Prayer Song, now is a good
time to recruit some more people for your town, TownShip.  If you've been
following my recommended tenant recruitment list thus far, you should only
have two houses that are vacant, which means you have to find two more
residents.  "Hanz" and "Daiye" are the two best tenants for each house, and
here's where you can find them:

House     Tenant        Location
=====     ======        ========
5         Hanz          In HomeTown, inside the house next to Ryu/Bow's house
6         Daiye         On the 2nd floor of the inn in Windia

Hanz opens up an item shop, which sells some very valuable items.  You can
buy some of the items, give them to your carpenter (assuming you got the
cook carpenter), and get most of your characters' stats extremely high.

Daiye opens up a fish store.  He's the only tenant that can live in House 6
that's useful in your quest.  You can pick up a lot of rare items and
equipment by fishing around.

After recruiting (or not recruiting) the last two tenants, you should go back
to TownShip.

Buy whatever you want from Hanz, Daiye, and the rest of the tenants.  Once
you're done shopping around, find the well located on the northeast end of
TownShip and enter it.  While down there, enter the next room and explore
it.  You can't do anything in here, but you're actually triggering something
in the game.  Take note of the machine inside, and after searching the room,
just exit the well.  Change up your party if you like, but make sure you add
Spar to the party, and warp to Guntz.

From Guntz, head east and enter the Wise Tree.

tell you about a woman named "Eichichi," who researches all types of
machinery in Guntz.  Guntz is where you should go to next.

Go to the northern building in town and you'll notice a lot of books inside.  
Go behind the easternmost bookcase and you should find yourself going down a
ladder into a secret hiding place.  Talk to the person inside.  Her name is
"Eichichi," the same Eichichi that the Wise Tree east of Guntz told you
about.  If you entered the well in TownShip and explored it, she should talk
to you and introduce herself as an engineer.  She'll ask you a yes or no
question, but the game messed up here, because you can't select a choice.  
Anyway, as the conversation continues, Eichichi asks you what you need from
her.  If you say "body," then she'll joke around with you.  Say "machine,"
and she'll carry on about how she loves machinery.  You'll tell her that you
know of a machine that's hidden under TownShip, and she'll be excited about
it and want to go there.

Eichichi will go to TownShip on her own, so just leave Guntz and warp back
there.

Once in town, go north towards the fort, and talk to the guard while Nina is
in the lead of the marching order.  She'll ask the guard to give the king a
message that she has returned.  The guard doesn't seem to want to do it, but
the queen shows up and tells the guard to let them inside.  "Hina" then
explains about the black wings legend, and that she kept Nina away from
Windia for her own good.  She then tells you that Nina's father, the king, is
ill and would very much like to see Nina.

| MoonDrop:  Search the dresser inside the king's bedroom.     |
o--------------------------------------------------------------o

Once you have control of your party, go up either of the two stairways.  On
the next floor, go up the western stairway and you'll be in the king's
bedroom.  With Nina still in the lead of the marching order, go to the right
of the bedside and talk to the king.  The king will be grateful Nina still
recognizes him as her father, and a flashback occurs.  In the flashback, it
is clear that the king was only trying to protect Nina by having her leave.  
Afterwards, a messenger from St. Eva asks the king if he will have the
teachings of St. Eva spread across Windia.  The king declines, saying it
would be wrong to force down beliefs on the people.  The messenger threatens
the king before leaving, and then Nina asks "Gramps" for a favor: to open the
basement of the castle.  Nina tells the party that she wants to become the
Great Bird, even if it means that she won't be able to revert to her normal
self again.

Back to having control of the party, go back down the stairways until you're
back at the first floor where the queen is.  You'll notice four doorways;
enter the westernmost door, and the gate should be open, allowing you to
enter the stairway down into the basement, "Sky Cave."

| MarkWing*:  After defeating Guardian, Nina's ancestor gives it to you.    |
o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Follow the path and you'll be able to either go north or continue west.  
Going north leads you to a treasure chest, which contains a StormRG, a great
weapon for Nina.  However, you will have to go through a lot of stairways to
get to it, and you'll actually find the treasure chest back inside the
fort.  Continue west and enter the stairway going down to continue with the
dungeon.

Go down the next two stairways, and enter the doorway to find yourself in a
cave with a pond inside.  Inside the cave, continue north and you'll find a
statue of a Windia soldier.  Talk to it while Nina is in the lead of the
marching order, and it will ask you if you wish to go forward and undergo the
"test."  Say yes, and Nina will be transported to a different room of the Sky
Cave.

As only Nina, you will be in a room where there are a lot of statues and
boulders.  The trick here is to continue moving so that the rocks don't
block the paths you want to go to.  If a rock is blocking you, take a couple
of steps so that it moves away from the spot you want to go to.  If you go
east and then north, you can find a treasure chest.  Likewise, going west and
then north also grants you another treasure chest.  You definitely should get
both chests, since one of them contains a great piece of armor for Nina.  The
battles here will be tough for Nina since she's fighting alone, so make sure
you continually use Smoke items to avoid as many battles as you can.  If Nina
gets into any battles, cast the Death spell, as it works really well against
the enemies here.  Make sure you use HelpBLs in-between battles to restore
Nina's HP.  You can talk with each of the statues if you want, but you need to
go inside the doorway northwest of where you start inside the room.  However,
before entering the doorway, make sure Nina's HP is full because you'll be
fighting a boss shortly.

After entering the doorway, the "Guardian" will ask Nina why she wishes to
turn into the Great Bird.  Nina says that it's the only way to save the
world, and then the Guardian asks Nina to prove how determined she is by
battling with her.  Be prepared.

##################
# Boss Battle 29 #
# Guardian       #
##################

The great thing about battling Guardian is that Nina will, usually, be first
to attack.  Have Nina cast Freeze to deal about 100 points of damage.  Cast
it again and Guardian will be defeated.  This should be an extremely easy
battle as long as you followed this strategy.

After defeating Guardian, she'll give you the "mark of the wing," and then
reveal her true form as Nina's great, great, great, great grandmother--by the
same name.  Nina gets surprised, and her ancestor explains why the power of
the Great Bird no longer exists in the family.  She fell in love with someone
of a different tribe, and the powers eventually disappeared.  Nina's ancestor
then asks you one last question:  do you forgive her for sacrificing the
power of their tribe?  Saying yes would probably be the best case scenario
unless you want Nina to be mean to her ancestor.  After answering her question,
it's time for you to get back to your party.

Talk to the statues if you wish since their dialogue is different now, but you
still have to battle enemies so be cautious.  Talk with the statue in the
center of the room and it will ask you if you wish to return to the others--
say yes.

Back in control of your party, exit Sky Cave and get back inside Windia Fort.

Go back to the king and talk to him with Nina in the lead of the marching
order.  Nina will tell her father that she has obtained the mark necessary to
become the Great Bird.  The king asks Gramps to escort her to the ceremony,
and the rest of your party leaves Nina alone with the king.  The king asks
Nina if she is doing this for the right reason, and Nina explains that she's
trying to save the world.   The king believes in Nina, and says he'll never
forget her.  You'll now be sleeping in your room in preparation of the
ceremony.  During nighttime, a scene takes place:  A woman goes inside the
dresser and steals the mark of the wing.  Once Nina wakes up, search the
dresser and Nina will realize the mark is missing.  She then thinks Mina took
it.  Your goal now is to find where Mina is.  Go north outside the bedroom,
and head west and enter the southern staircase.  You'll now be in "Ceremonial
Tower."

Continue going up the staircases, and you'll spot Mina along the way.  Once
you reach the top, Mina will lock the door inside the ceremonial room and
Nina will question Mina.  Nina continues to bang the door, and Mina explains
that she wants to do her part to save the world.  Mina ends the conversation by
telling Nina to remember to still call her by her own name when she becomes
the Great Bird.  The ceremony begins, and Mina turns into the Great Bird.

After turning into the Great Bird, Mina tells Nina she is happy to be of
service to her.  The rest of the party arrives, and Nina tells them she
doesn't want to cry about what just happened, at least not until they defeat
the demon who is behind all of this.  You automatically leave Windia and Mina
carries you on her back.

Now that you have control of Mina, you may be wondering where to go to next.  
Although you should find St. Eva Church now, land Mina by pressing the Y
BUTTON on the Controller, and go back to Windia and head inside Windia Fort
(make sure it's daytime or you won't be able to enter).

Once inside Windia Fort, enter the second doorway going from west to east.

inside the treasure chests, so do so.

It's time now to head for "Evrai."  Evrai is found on a large island south of
Guntz, and is only reachable via flight.  It's a big town north of a small
hut.  Ignore the hut for now (we'll be going inside it later), and just enter
Evrai.

Evrai is the home of St. Eva.  Talk with everyone in town, and they'll tell
you how wonderful St. Eva is.  Explore all the houses, and make sure you
speak to the person in the house north of the first two homes who says,
"Let's praise St. Eva..."

Talk to the guard all the way north of town, and he'll tell you that only
serious believers are allowed inside the "Grand Church."  Exit Evrai, and as
you try to, you'll find out that you can't.  Go back inside the house north of
the first two homes and talk to the person again.  She'll introduce herself as
"Claris," and help you find your way out of town by showing you a secret exit.

She'll tell you that something fishy is definitely going on with St. Eva Church
and the people of Evrai, as if their souls are being taken away from the
church.  Claris also tells you that you should head to "Cot Land," as her
friend there will be of help to you.  Enter the toilet when you're ready.

This dungeon is tough if you don't follow the correct path, so don't fool
around here.  Surprisingly, there aren't any items in here.  If at any time
you feel like you need to rest up your characters, go back up the stairs you
just went down to get here, and then talk to Claris in the western room.

From the beginning of the dungeon, you'll notice an opening just to the right
of you.  Enter it, and then fall down into the hole.  You'll fall a couple
floors down, and then land in a hallway.  Continue north, going up the
flights of stairs, and then enter the bronze staircase.  You'll now be out of
the dungeon.

| CharmRod:  Search the dresser in the northern room of the 2nd floor.      |
o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

It's as if you've stumbled into someone else's home!  Head south into the
next room and talk with the man standing in front of you.  He'll ask you what
you were doing in there, and then send you off to "your" room.  Before
exiting the shrine, head upstairs and search the dresser in the northern room
for a CharmRod, which happens to be the best rod in the game.  Now that you
have it, you should go to a secret fishing spot east of TownShip, and fish
out Ryu's best weapon in the entire game:  the "EmpireSD."

Land Mina on the peninsula just a tad east of TownShip, where there are many
silver mountains.  Walk around with what limited space you have, and enter a
battle.  You should be fighting weak enemies like Gongheads and E.Sludges.  
Keep entering battles until you see a fishing spot on the map.  With Ryu in
the lead of the marching order, have him stand next to the fishing spot and
press the A BUTTON on the Controller to begin fishing.  You should see a ton
of fish and a treasure box submerged inside the water.

You'll need to equip yourself before you can actually cast your line, so
equip Ryu with a CharmRod and some bait.  The best bait you can have is Gold--
which you should already have about five of.  You can also use Shrimp because
the fish in the fishing spot shouldn't be attracted to it as you make your line
to nab the treasure chest underwater.  Go back to the fishing screen and cast
your line.  Try to put some power into it and fish the treasure box out of the
water by rapidly pressing the A BUTTON on the Controller.  If you did it
correctly, you'll end up with the EmpireSD.  You can fish the EmpireSD without
using the CharmRod, but it will not be as easy.

Now that you've gotten the EmpireSD, it's time to continue with the game.  
Remember what Claris told you earlier about Cot Land?  It's south of Farm
Town, so just have Mina fly you there.  Before going, though, make sure Katt
is in your party if she isn't already.

You'll notice some boulders blocking your way north.  Put Katt in the lead of
the marching order, and have her activate her special power to break each
boulder with her stick.  Talk to the guard up top, and he'll let you pass.  
Enter the first house to your right, and the boss, "Tiga," will speak to you.

Tiga and Katt chat about St. Eva, and Tiga tells the party that he and his
comrades are planning on destroying the Grand Church--the only problem is
that they need money, and their "sponsor" left for "Thieves Tomb" and hasn't
returned yet.  Katt tells the rest of the party to find the sponsor so they
can fight St. Eva together with Tiga.

Thieves Tomb is located on the southeast continent of the world of Breath of
Fire II, just south of Highfort, in the desert surrounded by a river.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Talk with the thieves on the 1st floor if you'd like.  They tell you that
they've given up trying to steal because the traps inside are so difficult to
bypass.  Go down the staircase to the lower floor.

On this floor, the Monster Meter will be asleep, meaning you won't have to
fight any battles.  However, there are a bunch of moving holes that will
cause you to fall into the next floor.  Try  opening all the treasure chests
without falling down a hole..  Should you fall into the next floor, just go
back up the staircase nearby.  When you're ready, go down to the next floor.

This floor is completely different from anything you've experienced thus far.  
Talk to the old man, and he'll explain that the faces on this floor have
different expressions:  angry, smile, healthy, and strange.  Step onto one of
the faces, encounter a battle, and after returning from the battle, something
will happen depending on which face you're currently on (multiple effects are
numbered for each face).

Face        Color      Effect(s)
====        =====      =========
Angry       Purple     1.  Fall into a trap
2.  Lose all but 1 HP
3.  Become poisoned
4.  Drop 500 C

Smile       Bronze     1.  Obtain 100 C
2.  Party recovers full HP and AP
3.  Find a shortcut
4.  Obtain MoonDrop

Healthy     Green      1.  Character in lead of marching order fully recovers
(HP only)

Strange     Blue       1.  Find 1 C
2.  Drop 300 C
3.  Obtain StarrSD
4.  Character in lead of marching order becomes cursed

Perhaps the hardest effect to trigger is obtaining the StarrSD.  It's a
terrific weapon, but it's not as powerful as the EmpireSD.  If you're not going
for a perfect file, do not worry yourself over missing it.

Your goal is to find your way north from the path.  It's just like a board
game; try not to step onto the purple squares whenever possible or you may
fall into a trap and have to start all over again.  Enter the doorway into
the next room.

Inside this room, head north, then south, and you'll find someone locked
inside.  Step on the dark tiles in front of the gate to open it, and the
person will run north into the next room.  Follow her, and you'll discover
who the person is:  Patty.  She opens the treasure chest and discovers nothing
inside, but feels that there's more to it than that.  Talk to Patty again, and
she'll tell you that there should be a switch inside this room.

Examine the treasure chest Patty opened, and you'll find a switch.  Press the
switch and a secret passage opens up.  Enter it and you'll be in a room just
like the previous one.  Open the treasure chest, and you'll find the "Evidence"
which will help you be able to buy weapons for the resistance against St. Eva.
Go back to the previous room and Patty will bump into you.  She leaves, and you
should too.

Go back to Cot Land.

Go back inside Tiga's house and he'll greet you.  Patty will be there as
well.  Tiga, from out of nowhere, asks Katt to marry him.  Katt gets
surprised, and doesn't know what to say.  Tiga thinks that there may be
something going on between Ryu and Katt, and then challenges him.

You'll end up outside Tiga's house, and Tiga asks Ryu before fighting him if he
and Katt are just friends.  Saying yes will prompt Tiga to ask you if it's okay
with you if he and Katt get married.  If you say no to either of the two
questions, you'll have to battle it out with Tiga.

#############################

# Tiga                      #
#############################

There isn't any way you can win this fight, so in the long run, it doesn't
matter if you fight him or not because you will lose.

Afterwards, Tiga tells everyone that they will attack tomorrow, and then a
scene takes place; Katt is by the bonfire and Tiga approaches her.  Tiga and
Katt discuss the idea of love, and Katt tells Tiga that what she feels for him
really isn't "love."  Tiga doesn't understand, but asks Katt to stand by him
when they attack St. Eva Church.

The party wakes up, but as you can tell, Katt isn't with you.  The soldier
tells you that it's time for you to head for "Bando" and begin the attack.  
Exit Cot Land, but before heading for Bando, warp to TownShip and bring in a
fourth member into your party.

Now it's time to head for Bando.  Bando is located on the southern tip of the
same continent Cot Land is on.  You can get there by walking south from Cot
Land, but instead, have Mina fly you there and save yourself the trouble.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Enter the church, and you'll find that everyone from the resistance is
already here.  Talk with Tiga, and he'll tell the party that it looks like
they were too late in their ambush since no one is here.  Katt gets angry and
then whacks her staff against the center wall.  To everyone's surprise, a
secret passage appears and Tiga asks the party if they think that the priest
may be inside.  Saying no will get you nowhere, so just say yes, and go
inside the passage.

Keep in mind that this is a dungeon, so be prepared to battle.  From the
beginning of the dungeon, head north and a soldier will stop you and tell you
that he cannot allow you to continue any further.  This isn't a real boss
battle, so just continue to attack him to make short work of him.

Afterwards, continue north, battling your way through the passage, and you'll
spot a set of stairs going down.  As you approach the stairs, the priest will
run up to and enter them from his hiding place.  Go down the stairs into the
next floor.

On this floor, it should become apparent as to what you should do:  step on
the two arrow tiles to make the doorway move right or left.  Stepping on the
tile with the arrow pointing left makes the doorway move left (but you can't
make the doorway move any more left than where it starts out), and stepping
on the tile with the arrow pointing right makes the doorway move right.

Here's a table depicting exactly what happens when you step on the right arrow
tile (by order of number of times).

Step On Right Arrow Tile...     Result After Entering Doorway
===========================     =============================
Once                            A treasure chest containing a weapon for Katt
Two times                       Two people locked up by the priest
Three times                     Two more people locked up by the priest
Four times                      A stairway leading you further into the dungeon

It's not necessary for you to talk with the people locked up by the priest,
so don't waste your time going back and forth from the doorway and the tile.  
Step on the right arrow tile four times and head right to enter the doorway
and go down the stairs to continue with the dungeon.

On this floor, you can either go north or south.  Going south leads you to a
stairway that will take you to a treasure chest (but also a dead end).  Go
north if you  want to continue further into the dungeon and then go down the
set of stairs.

It appears as if you're inside a grave from the look of things.  Go south,
east, and then north to find "Father Manson."  Before approaching him,
though, make sure Ryu has full AP and everyone have full HP.  Father Manson
will ask you if you have something against St. Eva.  The party doesn't
reply, and he then tells you that he took the "believers" to the Grand Church.
Father Manson then turns into a demon and summons three Zombies to attack you.

##################
# Boss Battle 31 #
# Zombie X3      #
##################

The battle with the Zombies should be easy, so don't waste your AP casting
any attack spells.  Cast curative spells and use HelpBLs on your party before
defeating the last Zombie, as you'll want to be at full strength before
fighting Father Manson.  After defeating the Zombies, Father Manson will want
to kill you.  Get ready.

##################
# Boss Battle 32 #
# Necroman       #
##################

Have Ryu open up by casting his dragon power.  After that, have Ryu attack
for the rest of the battle unless you need him to help curing.  Rand should
always attack, or cure when needed.  Nina should continue to cast Hail to
inflict maximum damage.  Spar should cast Def-UpX first on the party, and
then cast Freeze.  You should be dealing about 400 points of damage per round
of combat if you're following this strategy.  Be careful--Necroman can cast
the Death spell which can instantly defeat one of your party members.

After defeating Necroman (a.k.a. Father Manson), he'll tell you that the day
his "God" will appear will arrive shortly.  A treasure chest suddenly appears,
so open it for an "Evrai RD," which will allow you to enter and exit Evrai
freely without any problems.

First, you need to exit the dungeon, so have Spar cast Exit.  Once you're
back inside the main floor of the church, you'll discover a priest and a nun.  
To your surprise, though, it's just Katt and Tiga dressed up in clothing.  
Katt asks Ryu if they found a way to get to Evrai.  Then, Tiga tells everyone
to act like believers of St. Eva and to study their teachings.  As everyone
leaves, Katt asks Ryu if he's mad that she decided to stay with Tiga.  Saying
no will hurt Katt's feelings a little, so say yes that you're mad (to show
that Ryu likes her).  Katt will explain that she wants to stand by Tiga when
they attack St. Eva, but she still doesn't want to be his wife.

The scene switches back to Cot Land, and then Tiga asks the party if they
know the teachings of St. Eva.  You probably haven't taken the time to go to
a church and learn them, so answer no.  Tiga tells you to learn about St.
Eva, and then leaves.  Katt informs you that she and Tiga are off to Evrai,
and that they'll meet you at Claris's house.

It's time now to head for HomeTown.

Enter the church a little to the north, talk to the father, and donate 20
times for 2000 coins (20 x 100 coin donations).  After the last donation, the
father should reward you with "EvansBib," a bible about St. Eva that reveals
the full name of Eva:  "Evans."  (Check your Special Item list.)

Change up your party at the dragon shrine in the eastern part of town if you
like, but make sure you bring your most powerful characters (including Nina).

As Katt told you earlier, everyone is meeting inside Claris's house, so go on
in.  Talk with Tiga, and he'll inform you that Claris hasn't shown up, but
that they can't worry about her now.

The scene switches outside of Claris's house, and the resistance gets
questioned from the soldier guarding the church.  The soldier asks the
resistance members to recite the teachings of St. Eva, but then finishes up
before he gets to you.  He assumes that you really do know about the
teachings, but as you try to open the door, he decides to ask you one
"simple" question:  what is the real name of St. Eva's god?

As you already  found out, it's "Evans," so select that choice.  If you select
the wrong choice, then you'll have to fight the soldier and defeat him.  After
answering him, enter through the door and enter St. Eva Church.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Inside the church, there are three doorways, but the one you need to enter is
the center one past the stairs.  In the next room, Tiga informs you that
"Habaruku," the founder of St. Eva, will be giving a sermon, and when the
time is right, they will go after him.  For now, you will be seated and the
sermon begins immediately.  Habaruku welcomes everyone and begins by speaking
about those who don't believe in St. Eva.  He even goes as far to say that
there is a nonbeliever in the room as he speaks.  Katt gets a little nervous,
but it seems that Habaruku wasn't talking about the resistance.  A woman--
more precisely, Claris--appears entrapped inside a bubble!  Everyone at the
sermon begins to order her to be killed, and Katt and Tiga just don't know
what to do about it.

Then, a surprising next couple of events take place:  Habaruku decides to try
to get Claris to become a believer rather than kill her.  But what is so
remarkable is that Habaruku is reading Claris's mind and knows all about her
and the resistance!  The air gets sucked out of her lungs, and she just can't
understand how he's reading her mind.  Habaruku reveals one huge secret about
Claris:  she loves Tiga.  Habaruku tells her that Tiga will never save her
because she is just a subordinate to him.  Tiga realizes that he is in love
with Claris, not with Katt, and vows to try to save her on his own.  Tiga
walks up to Habaruku and tells him that he wants to kill him for what he's
done.  Tiga tries, but he can't harm Habaruku, and then gets defeated by him.  
With a snap of his fingers, he tells Claris to "join" Tiga, and kills her!  
Tiga says Claris's name once last time, and then Habaruku takes care of them
both for good.

The scene switches back to the party.  Katt gets enraged and tells Ryu that
St. Eva is the problem, not the resistance.

The game now asks you to make a party of four members.  Make a party of Ryu,
Rand, Katt, and Spar, or bring your three best characters.  Now that you have
control of your party, make sure you equip Katt with the SnakeST, which you
might have gotten in Bando, and walk up to Habaruku.  As you approach him, he
ends the sermon and enters the eastern door.  Follow him inside, and he'll
ask you if you're indeed Tiga's friends.  Ray comes down, and Habaruku orders
him to dispose of Ryu and the gang.  Ray says that he has to do what he has
to do.  Get ready...

##################
# Boss Battle 33 #
# Ray            #
##################

You won't have to use any true offensive strategy for this battle, so just
have Ryu attack Ray to make the battle progress and everyone else cure,
especially after Ray does his trademark attack which will knock off 140+
points of damage to everyone in the party.  After Ray does this attack,
something special will happen, and it's good.  Ryu will learn a new dragon
power during the battle:  Gold Dragon.  Check Ryu's spells, and cast "G.Drgn"
to hurt Ray--so much so that it ends the battle.

Ray will tell Ryu that he will add his strength to his.  He also mentions
that Daisy is being held upstairs, but before he dies, he asks Ryu to create
a world where there is a God that everyone can truly believe in.

Back in control of your party, head up the next couple of stairways and
you'll find Daisy locked up in a cell.  Habaruku is standing nearby and asks
if Ray "knows" you.  He then tells you that Ray was worthless, and leaves.  
Open up the cell for Daisy by pressing the switch to your left, and put Rand
in the lead of the marching order.  Talk to Daisy, and she'll tell you that
the gray wall nearby is about to break, and if Rand were to use his special
power, he'd be able to break it.  Stand in front of the middle of the wall,
and press the Y BUTTON on the Controller to activate Rand's special power and
break it.  Daisy tells you to go after the bad guys, so go up the stairs onto
the next floor.

On this floor, open the two treasure chests nearby and head east up the next
staircase.  On this next floor, put Rand in the lead of your marching order
if he isn't already, and activate his special power while in front of the gray
wall to break it down.  All seems well until the other sets of walls close in
on Rand.  Rand asks the party to leave so they won't see his death in front
of their own eyes.  The party leaves, but Daisy comes to the rescue.  Daisy
confronts Rand, and then pushes him to safety, only to sacrifice herself for
her own son...

Afterwards, Rand rejoins the party and you're now on the next floor.  Open
the treasure chest in the center of the room for a BlastKN and have Rand equip
that.  Go up the next floor.

You should now be out in the open.  Head west and Habaruku will ask you if
you will quit following him.  Saying no will not allow you to continue with
the game, so say yes.

Afterwards, Habaruku sends some of his minions to fight in his place.  The two
Archers should be relatively easy for you to defeat.  After defeating them,
Habaruku runs off.  Follow him (east), and talk to him.  Habaruku seems to be
playing a game with you, and falls down into the depths of the church, you
along with him.

Once you land, you'll be on a new floor of the church.  Head into the
northeast opening for a treasure chest.  Next, go into the northwest opening
for another treasure chest and go up the next stairs.

You'll now be in a room with an arrow-moving platform.  Step on the arrows to
make the platform move in the direction the arrow is facing.  If you wish to
get the treasure chest on this floor, then from the start, step right, up,
right, right, down, up, and down.  You'll have to fall down after getting the
chest, but the reward is well worth it (some great armor).  To get to the
stairs going down, from the start, go right, up, right, right, down, and then
up.

After going down the stairway, head into the next room.  You'll hear a voice
asking who's there.  Proceed north, but be careful because there are eyes who
can shoot laser beams that deal 30 points of damage to each of your members.  
Don't let any of your characters HP get too low here.  Once you make it past
the eyes, restore everyone's HP and continue.

Now, after restoring your characters' HP, stand in front of the mirror-like
object and search it.  What appears to be an old man held captive by a
machine shows itself to you.  The old man begs you to kill him because the
machine is sending his energy to a demon that will awaken if he is not
killed.  You will now have to fight the machine and the old man...

############################
# Boss Battle 34           #
# Oldman and Guardeye (x3) #
############################

Do not, absolutely d-o n-o-t, attack the Old Man!  (Why you might ask?  If you
must know, you'll need to read the secrets section, but I would rather not
spoil this for you.)

Instead, concentrate your attacks on each of the Guardeyes, one by one.  This
means that you can't cast spells that affect multiple targets like Ryu's dragon
powers (but you can still use his weaker puppy powers to target one Guardeye).
If you attack the Guardeyes accordingly, you can abuse their elemental
property by casting a puppy power that is the opposite of the element.

(Keep track of which Guardeyes are casting Flame and Freeze and attack with
the opposite elemental puppy power.)

Use spells like Freeze that affect only one enemy, and continue to attack.
Each Guardeye will continue to do the same thing in each round, so it's
advisable you first defeat the Guardeye who continually casts Flame (the one
that is below the Old Man) so it doesn't end up defeating your party.  After
defeating that particular Guardeye, the battle should become a lot easier.
From there, defeat the other two Guardeyes, and the battle will be over.

After defeating the Guardeyes, the Old Man will thank you and the machine
will then get out of control.  St. Eva Church begins to crumble and the old
man decides to use his magic to teleport the party back to TownShip.

                                       *

o----------------o
| 106.  TownShip |
o----------------o
o------------------------------o
| Party:  Ryu, Bow, Rand, Nina |
| Level:  37                   |
| Items:  None                 |
o------------------------------o

You'll find out soon enough that the Old Man is blind.  The other party
members mention Ryu's name and the Old Man asks if he's there.  Take a good
second look at the Old Man, and it should become apparent to you that he is
none other than Ganer, Ryu's father!  Ganer mentions Yua, and a flashback
occurs.

Ganer explains to Ryu what happened on that day several years ago when he found
a different Gate.  Aruhameru, a demon, stole the memories of the villagers so
that they would be forced to work for his God.  Ganer opposed him, and was
soundly defeated and tied to the machine for his punishment.  Ganer then
mentions that if the demon is no longer gaining energy from St. Eva believers,
then it's probably getting it from somewhere else.

You now have control of your party.  If you haven't noticed by now, you're
actually on the second floor of the Carpenter's house, so exit and your next
destination will be the well in the eastern part of town.

Inside the well, enter the main room and you'll find Eichichi getting excited
over something very, very big.  She'll tell you that she's discovered a
machine that can let TownShip fly.  The only problem is that she has no clue
what energy it needs.  Ganer comes in and tells you that the machine runs on
human energy, similar to that of the machine that drained his energy to the
Demon.

Ganer then attaches himself to the machine and asks the party to find out what
is wrong with the world.  It seems Ganer is willing to sacrifice his own life
for a good cause, but don't worry, as it won't come to that, thanks to Eichichi
who will take care of Ganer.  Once you have control of your party, talk with
Eichichi and ask her to move the controls.  You now have control of TownShip
and can fly anywhere you wish.

Your next destination is where you started the game, the town of Gate.  
Before entering Gate, though, there are two places you should revisit that
will lead you to recruit two new shamans.  Skip the next two sections if you're
not interested since they're optional, but it's highly advised you don't.

First, warp back to Farm Town.

### Scenario 21 - The Return to Gate

| Items:  None                                   |
o------------------------------------------------o

Well, what could be so important for you to postpone your trip to Gate and
defeat the demon?  The Earth Shaman, "Solo," of course.  Enter through
Daisy's house and step onto the plowing field.  If you donated 2000 coins in
the Namanda Shrine, Solo will be standing there.  Talk to her and she'll
gladly warp back to TownShip and stay with Granny until you need her.

Now that you have the Earth Shaman, it's time to go after the second shaman,
which can be found in the church of Bando.  (Remember Bando is on the southern
tip of the western continent [just go south of Farm Town]).  Enter Bando when
you're ready.

o----------------------------------------------o

Enter the church and continue north into the secret passageway beneath the
statue (this should all be familiar to you).

You're now inside the dungeon.  From the stairway, head north and enter the
next stairway going down.  On this next floor, enter the doorway to your
right, and you'll find the Holy Shaman, "Seny."  Talk to her and she'll
reluctantly head back to Granny so you can unite with her.  Exit Bando.

Now that you've got two new Shamans, you're probably itching for some uniting!
Head back to TownShip and make your final preparations before departing for
Gate.

Now it's time to head for Gate.  The best way to describe where Gate is is to
start from TownShip's original location (which is south of HomeTown).  From
there, head west until you see the island where Tunlan is located on your
screen.  From Tunlan, head north, and once you see a new continent appearing,
head east a little to find a burnt down forest and the town, Gate, in the
middle of it.  Land TownShip just outside the forest.

...Or, you can just have someone warp you there!  Gate should be under the
list of towns you can warp to at this point in the game.

...Unfortunately, there's yet another place you should go to before entering
Gate.  Put Spar in the lead of the marching order if he isn't already, and
enter the Wise Tree near Gate.  (Once again, this next area is optional so
feel free to skip right to Gate if you don't want to waste any time.)

After talking with the tree, you'll understand that it appears the demon is
sucking away the forest's energy, just as Ganer thought earlier.  There aren't
any items here, so just leave and enter Gate.

|     walkthrough, which contains a treasure chest containing the EmpireSD,  |
|     the best weapon for Ryu, that TownShip will not be able to land on.    |
|     If you want to get this special weapon, this is your last chance.  See |

As you enter Gate, everything should be completely familiar to you, except
for one thing:  the town's residents.  It seems no one is around.  Feel free
to search the church and the other homes, but there won't be any items
around.  If you enter the northern most house, you can speak to the mayor of
Gate, "Ross."  Continue north, and into the opening of trees to enter BushLnd
once more.

o------------------------------o

As you should know by now, BushLnd has three paths you can enter.  You can
choose the west and east paths since they lead you to more residents of
Gate, who will explain to you that they are planning to bomb the Dragon since
they believe it is the one responsible for the forest.

Stay on the middle path and you'll spot the priest, "Hulk," standing near the
Dragon.  Talk to him, and the bombing will begin.  The doors the Dragon was
protecting open up, and demons come rushing out.  Hulk explains that he had no
idea the Dragon wasn't responsible for draining the life out of the forest, and
asks the party if they know someone named Patty.  Hulk asks the party to bring
Patty to Gate because she knows about the Dragon.

Before heading off to find Patty, though, you should first enter the west
opening of BushLnd.  Remember the doors that were sealed before the bombing?
Now that they are open you can enter them.  So enter the western door (the
eastern door leads you to the western door, and vice versa, so it doesn't
actually matter which door you enter), and you'll find the "Devil Shaman"
walking about.  Talk to her, and she'll introduce herself as "Shin," and head
to Granny's.  You have now acquired the last of the six shamans in Breath of
Fire II (congratulations)!

With the last of the six Shamans acquired, it's time to head back to TownShip
and try out the last set of possible Shaman combinations.

The following table depicts the remaining Shaman combinations involving the
Devil Shaman, Shin:

For the first time in the game, Katt can finally unite with a Shaman!
Unfortunately, only about half of the team can unite with the Devil Shaman,
Shin, but there are still many new uniting possibilities for you to explore.
Be sure to check out Bow's Seny & Shin unite.

Your next destination is Cot Land, which is where Patty is supposed to be
right now.  Exit Gate, and have one of your characters warp you there.

Once you reach Cot Land, head up to the higher level and speak to the blue
soldier running outside the houses.  He'll tell you that Patty left for a
"restaurant."  That could only mean that our next destination is Wild Cat.

Warp to SimaFort and head north to the Wild Cat Restaurant.

Enter the dining room inside and talk to the chef on the right.  He'll tell you
that Patty went to challenge "that grave" one more time.  Exit Wild Cat and
warp to Highfort.  Then travel by foot to the south near the lake, to reach the
Thieves Tomb.

Insides the Thieves Tomb, talk to the first person on the right wearing the
white hood and blue shirt.  He'll tell you that Patty is at the "new town,"
HomeTown.  Unfortunately, the Capcom translators goofed up here (once again).
They meant to say TownShip instead of HomeTown.  Warp to TownShip.

o------------------------------o

Enter the main house where your party members are staying (a.k.a. the house
next to the Unity Room).  Go up the stairs to reach the second floor and enter
the middle of the three doors.  You'll find Patty inside; talk to her.  You
tell her that the seal on the Dragon has been broken, and then she gets very
agitated.  Patty then thanks you for telling her, and leaves immediately.

Next stop:  Gate.

Take the middle path to get to where the action is.

Talk to Hulk and Patty will begin talking about the Dragon's current state.
Suddenly, a voice tells everyone to not come close.  The voice reveals itself
as the Dragon and the Dragon asks everyone to leave immediately in case the
Demon gets through.

Patty asks Father Hulk if something is wrong, and then Hulk reveals his true
identity:  Habaruku.  Habaruku tells everyone the story of the seal and how
the Dragon Clan is responsible for sealing the Demon God.  Habaruku levitates
Patty high up in the air and says that the only way to undo the seal is to
kill one of the Dragon Clan--Patty.  The Dragon suddenly moves and throws
Patty into the bushes, thus saving her from death.  Habaruku gets angry, and
then the Dragon asks Ryu and everyone to leave immediately.

Instead, talk to Habaruku and you'll challenge him to a fight.  Get Ready...

##################
# Boss Battle 35 #
# Babaruku       #
##################

(Another mistake by the game calling Habaruku, "Babaruku," when you fight him.  
This is just another typo, so don't get confused by this.)

The best strategy to defeat Habaruku is to have Ryu immediately open up by
casting Gold Dragon for 999 damage points.  Have your other characters use
WFruits and WiseBLs on Ryu to immediately restore his AP so that he can cast
it again in the second next turn.  With Ryu in-between turns, waiting to get
his AP maxed, have him attack with the EmpireSD, which should knock off a
couple hundred points of damage.  If Habaruku gets a chance to cast one of
his strong attack spells, make sure Bow casts Cure3 on the party or it could
spell disaster.  Repeat the process and Habaruku should go down in no time.

After defeating Habaruku, he gives a farewell speech about how there will be
a day when the Demon God will show himself to the world, and that the world
will truly suffer.  The Dragon tells you that Habaruku is merely being
controlled by the Demon, and that the Demon can no longer receive energy from
St. Eva since all of its founders are now officially dead.

The Dragon then asks Ryu an extremely important question:  should he allow
the Dragon to continue protecting the seal, hoping that the Demon won't be
able to show itself and break the seal, or does he want to confront the Demon
now and defeat it.  If you choose to "Wait," and reinforce your decision by
answering "Yes" again, you will get the worst ending in Breath of Fire II.  
In other words, do not select "Wait" if you wish to continue the game.

If you choose "Wait," the ending will tell you that the Demon became too strong
for even Ryu to challenge, and that the world's history will be frozen
forever, which sounds quite chilling when you see the picture of the Demon
and all of its minions.

After selecting "Defeat," make sure you answer "Yes" when the Dragon asks if
you really wish to defeat the Demon now.  The Dragon then raises her hands
and transforms into, what appears to be, a human with wings.  She calls Ryu
her "child," and asks that Ryu never regret the decision he just made.  Since
the only way the seal can be broken is to sacrifice one member of the Dragon
Clan, Ryu's mother--the Dragon--sacrifices herself for the benefit of the
world.

The gate is now open and you are free to enter the final dungeon in Breath of
Fire II:  Infinity.

Before you go on, though, it is recommended that you leave Gate and complete
the last set of side quests in Breath of Fire II, including getting a secret
character that has the potential to aid you greatly with her magic.  In
addition, if you've been following the suggested levels so far, you'll
definitely need to level up your party members even more.  Whatever you
decide to do, make certain you save your game first after that tough battle
against Habaruku.

The first side quest you should complete is getting the secret character of
Breath of Fire II.  Fly TownShip, or ride Grandpa to the shore spot just
southeast of the Thieves Tomb (there should be brown mountains in-between).  
You should now be on a desert.  Try walking on this small area of desert and
you'll notice an unusual looking square that could pass as a whirlpool; it's
just a couple steps north of the shore spot itself.  Step on it to enter
"Blue Room."

### Scenario 23 - On the Verge of His Awakening

o-----------------o
| 120.  Blue Room |

| Party:  Anyone |
| Level:  37     |
| Items:  2      |

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Items                                                                      |

| Cond.Up:  Take the northeast path and search the only unopened dresser.    |
|                                                                            |
| Tolen:    Take the northeast path and open the treasure chest on the left  |
|           side.                                                            |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Speak to the two spirits in the first room and they'll tell you that "Bleu"
is out.  The northwest path takes you to a bathroom, but there's not really
much you can do inside.  The northeast path takes you to another spirit who
tells you a little about Bleu's nature.  You can find a couple of items
stashed in this room, but other than that, there's nothing else left to do
here.

Leave Blue Room and then warp to HomeTown.  Once inside, go to the Magic
School.

                                       *

| 121.  Magic School |

| Party:  Anyone |
| Level:  37     |
| Items:  None   |
o----------------o

Go up the stairs to the second floor and head to the classroom on the west
side.  Speak to the southwest-most pupil and she'll reveal herself as the one,
the only, Bleu.  She forcefully joins your party, thus concluding your quest in
retrieving the secret character of Breath of Fire II.

Bleu joins in at LV35, which is just about the same level your party members
are probably at right now.

Now that you have all the characters in the game, you might as well try
getting some of the best equipment to equip them all with.  Next stop is
"Nightrider Island."

Nightrider Island is found directly east of Evrai.  (Remember, Evrai is on the
island south of Guntz.)  Nightrider Island is a somewhat small island that
features a hut and some palm trees, so keep your eyes open.  Once you reach
the island (which can only be accessed via flight), enter the hut.

                                       *

o----------------o
| Party:  Anyone |
| Level:  37     |
| Items:  None   |
o----------------o

There's no items here, but there is a merchant who can sell you some powerful
equipment.  This, and Baretta's shop in TownShip, feature some of the best
equipment in the game.  Buy whatever you can with what money you have, but
you should be building up your characters levels now anyway to get even more
coins.  Here's a short synopsis on the Nightrider Shop's wares:

Item         Character(s)     Details
====         ============     =======
DamageSD     Ryu              Buy this if you never got the EmpireSD
EmblemRP     Jean             Third Best rapier

It is recommended for the final part of the game that you have a party of
Ryu, Bow, Rand, and Bleu.  Or, you can substitute Bow or Bleu for either Nina
or Katt.  It's your preference, though, so go with what's been working for you
thus far.

To build up levels quickly, fight on Monster Island (which is directly south
of Evrai) and Nightrider Island.  On Monster Island, every so often, you'll
encounter a party of three K.Sludges; defeat them to earn over 80,000 EXP.

While the enemies on Monster Island give out more EXP, overall, there is an
enemy on Nightrider Island called (appropriately enough), N.Rider who drops
arguably the best shield in the game, the "MedusaSH," and Jean's best weapon,
the "NoTwinRP."  Both of these items are very rare drops though, so you may
want to bring a Sana & Spoo Shaman bonded Sten along for his Sweh command.

To add further insult to injury, the N.Rider pops up rarely, so be prepared to
spend a good amount of time fighting the D.Brngers.  N.Rider appears only at
night time, so a good strategy would be to use Timewarp when it's day time if
your goal is to encounter him as quickly as possible.

Try to gain at least ten levels so that Ryu is in his late level 40s.  If you
really want to be prepared for what lies ahead, level up to LV 50.

Head to TownShip while you're leveling for some other side quests.

                                       *

o----------------o

As just mentioned earlier, Baretta's Shop in TownShip sells some of the best
equipment in the game.  Go check on her if you haven't recently, and you'll
find she's got quite some new wares in.  (Note:  Apparently, if you didn't
recruit Baretta before the fall of Evrai she will not be selling these new
wares.)

Item         Character(s)     Details
====         ============     =======
DeathBW      Bow              Best bow
KaiserKN     Rand             Best knuckle
AmberRG      Nina and Bleu    Second best ring
MotherRB     Various          One of the best armors in the game
HeroAR       Various          One of the best armors in the game
ShinyHT      Various          One of the best helmets in the game
HolySH       Various          One of the best shields in the game

You'll notice I said the HeroAR is one of the best armors in the game, but
it's not the best overall.  Now it's time to find the best armor in the game,
the "LifeAR."  The LifeAR is found in a treasure box in a fishing spot east of
ShowCave 1F.  Have someone warp to Gate for you, and then head west.  
Continue fighting enemies until you see a fishing spot just east of the cave.

As mentioned previously when fishing for the EmpireSD, it is recommended you
bring the CharmRod and Gold bait to fish out the LifeAR.  You should have
acquired a couple of Golds by this point in the game, so hopefully you just
put them in the Bank if you can't find them in your party inventory.  Of
course, you don't have to use Golds as your bait; in fact you can fish the
LifeAR out just by using Worms.

In preparation for Infinity--the final dungeon of the game--and since you've
recently just acquired the last three shamans (Earth, Holy, and Devil), you
may find the following information useful.  It's a chart of every character
(all possible seven of them)'s best shaman fusion.  Some characters have
multiple outstanding fusions, so this list will help you decide on which
characters you wish to bring for the final showdown against the Demon God.  
It's possible to bring three characters (other than Ryu) fused into their
best possible form simultaneously!

Character     Shaman(s)         Bonuses                            Appearance

The final side quest for Infinity involves the Cook Carpenter, the Item Shop
in Guntz, and the two TownShip tenants, Hanz and Daiye.  If you've chosen
the Cook Carpenter in TownShip (found in the house near the well), have him
cook up some valuable items.  The following table shows what items you can
cook, what effect the item has, and the recipe required for the item.

Item         Effect        Recipe                  Recipe Location(s)

Herb         +HP           2 Charcoals             Failed cooking attempts

The Biscuit is an extremely important 'battle-only' item that restores all your
party members' HP, and increases their defense.  The WiseBL restores 100 AP to
any one character, which will prove useful in case you wish to fully restore
Ryu's AP so he can do substantial damage with his Dragon Powers.  Make sure you
cook up at least 18 WiseBLs and about a dozen Biscuits; you'll need them
desperately for the final battle.

Make sure you spend all the coins you possibly can, beefing up your
characters' strength, stamina, agility, wisdom, and guts.  If you're out of
coins and are really into raising your characters' stats, try the following
strategy out:

Buy three Cond.Ups from Hanz and cook all three of them.  You'll end up with a
GoldBar, which you can sell for 6000 coins.  The three Cond.Ups will cost you
3000, so you're making a profit of that same amount every time you sell the
GoldBar.

Now you have no excuses not to be able to have powered up characters.  One last
note about cooking:  there's a 1/8 chance that you may produce a Charcoal item
instead of the intended item you wished to cook.  This is normal, and doesn't
happen frequent enough to get upset about.

Once you've acquired all the items needed, beefed up your characters greatly,
and finished up any last-minute errands, it is now time to enter Infinity,
which rests beyond the main center door the Dragon was protecting in BushLnd,
in the town of Gate.

Once inside Infinity, you'll be able to either go west or east.  Both
directions connect around the room, but going east will take you to the stairs
leading to the lower level quicker by a couple of steps.  You'll notice a stake
left of you after going down the steps, but don't worry if you don't have Sten
in your party since it doesn't take you anywhere special.  Get to the next
lower level by walking down the next set of steps.  Travel east to find a
treasure chest, and then head south and enter the stairway down leading to the
2nd lowest floor.

On the 2nd lowest floor, head south, following the steps, then east across the
skinny path.  You'll come across a stake that leads to a treasure chest
containing a BusterBW, so the only way you can access it is if you have Sten
activate his special power (non specially bonded Sten).  There's no need to
acquire this treasure chest if you bought the DeathBW from Baretta in TownShip,
since it's the better weapon, unless you're going for a perfect file.  Continue
south of the stake across the next set of steps and then head west.  You'll be
able to go enter a doorway or go south and enter the stairs leading to the next
floor.  As well, if you go west of the doorway, then north, you'll reach a
treasure chest at the dead-end containing a NatureWP.  Ignore the stairway
south of the doorway because you'll miss a treasure chest if you take it,
even though it takes you to the next floor.  Enter the doorway, get the
treasure chest, and go down the stairs right of the chest to reach the 3rd
lowest floor.

On the 3rd lowest floor, if you go down the first set of steps and circle the
room, you'll reach a treasure chest at the dead-end.  Go down the steps and
continue circling the room, getting the treasure chest on the second lowest
level of the room.  Enter the stairway in the center of the room to reach the
4th lowest floor.

On the 4th lowest floor, you'll be able to go north or go down the steps.
Taking the path north will lead you to three treasure chests (two you'll find
east and then south into the doorway, and one you'll find by heading west and
circling the entire room), while going down the steps will take you where you
need to go.  Go down the steps south of the stairs, head west and take the
western upper path (the eastern upper path leads to a dead-end).  Go down the
next set of steps and enter the stairway south leading you to the 5th lowest
floor of Infinity.

The next six floors (count them as you go down each one of them) consist of
small rooms with stairways leading you further and further into Infinity.  Do
not be fooled even though the floors look as if they are repeating
themselves; you are not in some sort of "infinity" trap, but are actually
descending Infinity.  These floors are the 5th through 10th floors.

On the 11th lowest floor of Infinity, you'll finally reach a different
looking area.  This is actually an extremely large floor filled with stairs
(not to be confused with stairways).  From the start of the floor, you can
either go south or east.  Going south will eventually take you to two
treasure chests, but a dead-end follows.  Go after the treasure chests if you
wish, but only if your party is doing fine and you still have a good amount of
AP to work with.  Otherwise, skip the treasure chests and just head east.

Continuing east, follow the path of steps, making sure you get the treasure
chest containing the ImortlRG, the most powerful weapon for Nina and Bleu.

Head south from the ImortlRG chest and you'll be able to go west or continue
south.  Continuing south will lead you to a dead-end with a treasure chest
containing a ShadowDR.  Go west and continue traveling across the steps and
you'll have a choice between going southwest and southeast.  Going southwest
takes you to a dead-end, so go southeast and get the treasure chest nearby.

Travel east and then south and you'll be able to continue going south or west.
Head west since going south leads to (yet another) dead-end, and get the
treasure chest along the way for the FinalKN (despite what its name implies,
it's not Rand's best weapon).  You'll eventually be able to go north or south.
North leads to another dead-end, so head south, continuing across the sets of
steps.  You should (finally) see a stairway leading you to the next floor of
Infinity, so go down it.

Now on the 12th and final floor of Infinity, you'll find yourself in the
center of a large empty room.  Simply head south and enter the passage to
reach a new area...

An old man appears before you (appearing in a state of surprise) claiming
that Ryu, no doubt, is the destined child.  He then welcomes the party to
"Dologany," the town of the Dragon Clan, and asks that you see the Elder, as
everyone in town has been waiting for Ryu.

You are automatically sent to the Elder who explains a story that happened
long ago.  The story is about a brave dragon that defeated the Goddess,
"Miria."  After defeating her, the world was at peace...for a time.  You see,
Miria left behind a "scar" of some sort, a seed of darkness called "Deathevn."

The Elder explains that the reason they decided to not try to kill Deathevn is
because he still did not have a shape.  After growing in power from the
world's negativity and St. Eva, Deathevn has not only become something real
and visible, he has the potential to grow even more; so much more that if he
is not defeated now, there will be nothing alive that will be able to take
him down.  The Elder explains that this is the time to take action, or else
it could spell disaster for the world.

After the Elder's story is finished, you'll have control of your party.  If
you leave the room without talking to the old man in orange clothing nearby,
you won't be able to continue the game.  Talk to the old man and he'll
introduce himself as Ryu's grandfather, and Valerie's father.  After speaking
with him, exit the room...

Suddenly, you now have control of just Valerie inside Dologany.  Go back
inside the building you came out of just now and speak to the two people
inside.  It's Valerie's father, and the Elder.  After talking to them, it's
apparent that Valerie is about to undergo an important task.  Leave the
building and go down the ladder to your left to reach the lower level of
Dologany.

Speak to the Dologany residents in the houses if you wish, but you must speak
to Valerie's grandmother and say your goodbyes to her.  She's the woman
covered in a blue cloak in the eastern-most building on the lower level.  After
speaking to her, go back to the upper level of Dologany and enter the
building Valerie's father and the Elder are in.

"Martin" (Valerie's father) will give Valerie a jewel called the "Tear of the
Dragon" to help her when she leaves for the world outside.  The reason she is
leaving Dologany is because the only way the Dragon Clan will know when the
time is right to strike Deathevn is when the world begins to die.  Afterwards,
you are sent near the entrance to Dologany with the Dragon Clan hearing
Valerie's last words of wisdom before she departs.

After Valerie leaves Dologany she finds herself in Bush Land.

The houses are all locked.  The church is open, though, so enter it.  Head left
and talk to Ganer behind the desk.  You'll find out that Ganer has fallen in
love with Valerie at first sight, just by looking at the Dragon Tear.  Not only
that, but Valerie seems to have falling in love with Ganer as well.

The scene switches outside the church, with Valerie praying to the Dragon
God.  You find out that Valerie and Ganer are now married, and that Valerie
is carrying her second child.  Once you have control of Valerie again, head
back inside the church and travel to the second floor above.  Enter the room
to find Ryu, and talk to him.  He'll tell Valerie how he'll be the boss of
the next child, assuming it will be a boy.  Valerie asks Ryu what if the
child she is carrying is a girl, and Ryu says he won't be the boss of her.  
Valerie tells Ryu to take care of the new child.  Leave the room and go down
the stairs.

Ganer will confront Valerie and ask her to pray to St. Eva with him.  As the
family prays, Valerie wonders to herself about St. Eva and how strange it is.  
Time passes, and Valerie and Ganer now have two children.  The next scene
shows Valerie and Ganer in the church.  An earthquake occurs, prompting them
to find out what's going on outside.  Before going outside, you should go see
Yua and Ryu in their room upstairs.  Leave the church when you're ready.

You find out that demons have taken over the village.  Ganer fights with one
and asks Valerie to head back inside the church.  Instead, talk to the man
near the Dragon Shrine to find out that the demons are coming from the back
mountains.  You should now go to Bush Land.  (The demons you find in the
village won't fight you, so do not be afraid of them.)

Take the middle path up, passing the next demon by, and search the door.  
You'll find out that the seal has weakened a bit and that the demons are able
to come from the crack that Deathevn has created.  Valerie decides to seal
the doors permanently by transforming into a dragon.  Valerie says her
goodbyes to herself and then changes into the dragon, sitting on top of the
gates the demons came out of.

The scene changes back inside Gate with Ryu calling out to his mom.  A demon
attempts to attack Ryu, but Ganer defeats him just in time.  The two decide
to go to Bush Land and see what's going on.  After seeing the dragon, Ryu
notices the Dragon Tear shining.  Ryu and Ganer continue to ask themselves
where Valerie could be, and the Valerie scenario is concluded.

You are now returned back to the real game, inside Dologany.

Back in control of your party, you'll be outside the Elder's building.  Talk
to the old man in orange clothing to learn about a special power called
"Anfini."  Head down the steps on your left to reach the lower level of
Dologany and enter second of the three small buildings to rest and buy some
items, if you need them.  Make sure you save your game using the Dragon
Shrine on the upper level and head through the door of the tower (surrounded
by green fire) on the lower level.  Ryu must be in the lead of the marching
order.  You'll now be back inside Infinity.

Note:  To differentiate between the two Infinities between Dologany, I will
refer to this new Infinity as Infinity II.

|                                                                             |
| LifeBR:    With Katt in the lead of the marching order, whack directly      |
|            to the right of Barubary, then have Sten reach to get to a       |
|            treasure chest and open it.  (See walkthrough below for more     |
|            information.)                                                    |
|                                                                             |
| KingHT:    In the room that the orb takes you (after Barubary), head        |
|            southwest and open the treasure chest.                           |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

On the 1st floor here, your goal is to simply step on the tile in the
center of the room.  You'll be transported down on a platform elevator to the
next floor.  Something worth noting here is that you'll only be fighting
groups of E.Sludges, which are the green slime enemies you fought in the
beginning of the game.

On the 2nd lowest floor, head south, following the trail of steps.  You'll
spot a doorway you can enter to your right, so follow the path right to enter
it.

Inside the room, head north and drink from the clear water to restore your
HP/AP.  Talk to the wise men in white clothing to learn more about Anfini,
the ultimate power of the dragon.  Talk to the wise man in red clothing in
the center.  He'll ask you if you have any questions regarding the dragon
power, so say yes.  Ryu and the Wise Man of the Dragon will be shifted to a
different room.

The Wise Man of the Dragon will ask you to speak to the people in the rooms
first, so start by doing that.

From left to right, you'll notice seven accessible entrances leading to
different rooms.  A Breath of Fire II character occupies each room, and in the
rooms, you must speak to each character so that they 'join' your party.  After
they join you, continue north into the next room and talk to the character (who
will automatically be standing in the center of the room).  When finished
conversing, head back to the main room and repeat the process for the next
characters.

BOW        RAND        KATT        NINA        JEAN        STEN        SPAR

This is the order the characters are shown in the rooms, going from left to
right.  After talking to the characters, the Wise Man of the Dragon will ask
you to enter the doorway in the middle and speak to the person inside; do so.

Continue north into the next room and you'll find Ryu, yourself.  Talk to Ryu
and he'll ask you to choose one of your friends to sacrifice for the power of
Anfini.  Say yes when he asks if you understand, and then go back to the main
room where the Wise Man of the Dragon is.  He'll tell you that you must enter
the room of the person who you wish to sacrifice.

This is a trick question; if you enter any of the rooms where your other
party members are, you really aren't prepared to receive Anfini.  You must
choose to sacrifice Ryu, so enter the room you just came out of, or, if you
lost track, the fifth doorway going from left to right.  Go into the room
where Ryu was standing and speak to him.  He'll wonder if you're undecided as
to whom to sacrifice, and let you know that your friends are more than
willing to do whatever it is they must for you.  Ryu will then ask you to
choose someone now, but just say no to this question.  He will say that you
are weak, ask that you be brave, and choose someone this instant.  Say no
once more.  Ryu will then pester you once more by asking you the same
question.  Reaffirm your stance by answering no.

Ryu tells you that your journey ends here, but don't be afraid.  What happens
next appears to be a blackout of some sort.  Thankfully, Ryu is alive and
well when he wakes up near the sight of the other characters.  The Wise Man
of the Dragon tells you that you have passed the test by fighting against
your feelings to the very end.  Your reward is the most powerful of all
dragon powers:  Anfini.  Anfini is a special spell that only Ryu can cast,
and only in one particular battle:  against Deathevn.  It will be grayed out
until then.

Now that you have Anfini, you should leave the room and head back into the
main corridor of the floor.  Head south from the doorway and you'll be able
to either go southwest or southeast, following the steps.  Going southwest
takes you to a treasure chest containing a Noe'sRB, but will just lead you to a
dead-end.  Go southeast and follow the path of steps to reach the staircase
leading to the next floor.

On the 3rd lowest floor, you'll be in a new type of area--similar to the
insides of the Queen of Tunlan and Grandpa the Whale.  Simply enter the
doorway in the middle of the room to continue.  In the next room, going west
will take you to a treasure chest.  After getting the chest (the RiotST), head
east and you'll be able to go east or south.

Both directions lead to different rooms featuring ladders leading to different
parts of the fourth lowest floor.  Starting from this point, you have a
decision to make:  will you go south or east?  Both take you through the rest
of Infinity to the 8th (and final) floor, but both feature different
treasure chests along the way.  This walkthrough will show the path of the
eastern door's ladder first, and then recommend that you go back up the
southern door's ladder sections so you get all the treasure chests; all the
while, leveling up your party at the same time.

So take the eastern path from the RiotST treasure chest, enter the doorway, and
take the ladder down to the 4th lowest floor.

Here on the Eastern Ladder's path of the 4th floor, you'll be able to go
south or directly west.  Going south leads to a room with a treasure chest
containing a HolyRP.  Go west and circle the room through the path to reach the
ladder.  Then climb it down.

Here on the Eastern Ladder's path of the 5th floor, you'll notice a shiny
orb-like object with two doorways and a separate path leading north.  The
eastern doorway leads to an empty room, so now you've got two options left.  
The northern path will circle you around the room leading you to a new room
with a treasure chest containing a DragonSH, and a dead-end.  Enter the
northern doorway (near the orb) and take the ladder down to continue the
dungeon.

Here on the Eastern Ladder's path of the 6th floor, follow the path and
you'll find another orb-like object.  Stepping onto it will teleport you to a
different area of Infinity, but it is recommended that you do not step on it
since you'll be skipping some sections (you'll eventually reach the area it
takes you to by going south of the orb).  Going north of the orb will lead you
to a treasure chest containing a DragonAR.  Going south will take you to
another ladder leading further into Infinity, a Dragon Shrine (make sure you
save), and a doorway leading to another room.  The doorway (east of the Dragon
Shrine) leads to an empty room, so don't waste your time.  Climb the ladder
down to the next floor.

Here on the Eastern Ladder's path of the 7th floor, you should go west
and follow the path north into the next room.  Acquire the DragonSD from the
treasure chest and then go back to the ladder that led you to this floor.  Go
east of it, though it appears there is nothing of value.  Keep walking in this
area until you find a hole in the ground leading you to the next floor.  To
help pinpoint the hole in question, look for the branch attached to the wall
and then take two steps left of it.

Here on the 8th (and final) floor of Infinity, move north (ignore the path
extending east and north) and you'll find another orb.  Recall back to the
6th floor where there was another orb.  Stepping onto that particular orb
would lead you here.

Now you will make a decision:  do you wish to finish the game at this point (by
entering the door north of the orb) or do you want to finish the other half of
Infinity II (by climbing the ladder northeast of the orb)?  This walkthrough
will explain directions on completing the second half, and then walk you
through what's next.  For those attempting to complete the game at this point,
skip the next couple of paragraphs.  For those who want to follow what's
recommended, continue reading.

For now, ignore the door north of the orb and head northeast and climb the
ladder up.

Here on the Southern Ladder's path of the 7th floor (refer back to the
3rd floor for information on the Southern and Eastern Ladder variations of
floors four through seven), simply follow the path and climb the next ladder
up.  There is nothing of value on this floor.

Here on the Southern Ladder's path of the 6th floor, head north and you'll
notice a doorway.  Enter it and drink from the clear water to restore your
party members' HP/AP.  Exit the room and continue the path north, which will
extend northwest.  Climb the ladder up to the next floor.

Here on the Southern Ladder's path of the 5th floor, head south to find a
chest containing a HolySH.  Afterwards, continue west, then south, and climb
the next ladder up.

Here on the Southern Ladder's path of the 4th floor, you should notice a
ladder directly south of you leading up to the 3rd floor.  Ignore it for
now, and continue east.  When you spot a treasure chest on the screen, be
extremely careful; there's a hidden hole in the ground nearby.  The hole is
located one space down, and then one space left of the chest (meaning it's
located a value of one space diagonally left and down of the treasure chest).

The easiest way to avoid the hole is to make sure you walk directly to the
treasure chest instead of a space south of it.  If you happen to fall into the
hole, simply follow the path and climb the ladder up.  Head north after
climbing the ladder to return back to the treasure chest.  Open the treasure
chest for a DragonHT, and then return to the two ladders located west.  Climb
the southern ladder to reach the 3rd floor.

Here on the Southern Ladder's path of the 4rd floor, head south and out of
the room.  Continue east and then north, along the path to get back to the
Eastern Door's main path entrance.

Congratulations.  You have just completely annihilated (from front to back)
Infinity.  Now you are more than ready to conquer what lies ahead.  Since
your party may be exhausted at this point, you should exit back to Dologany,
regroup, rest, and save.

Unfortunately, you'll have to travel back through the depths of the second
half of Infinity once more, but it will all be worth it as you have saved
yourself the frustration of being unprepared for Deatheven.  Get back to the
8th floor; the Eastern Ladder's path from the 3rd floor is quicker than
the Southern Ladder's path since there's a teleport orb you can take that
will place you directly where you need to be (but you should save at the
Dragon Shrine found south of the orb, first).  Recall that you should be
entering the door on the 8th floor, north of the orb (drink from the clear
water by following the path the ladder northeast of the door takes you,
first).  The room inside should be pitch-black.

Inside the pitch-black room, continue north and you'll shortly hear a voice
asking you if you're the destined child.  Then the voice will ask you to come
forward.  As you continue traveling up, the voice will ask if you're scared,
and then it should become apparent as to who it is you're about to meet:  the
demon that young Ryu and young Bow faced in ShowCave 1F.  Prepare yourself
for the ultimate of bosses:  Barubary.

############################
# Boss Battle 36 A         #
# Barubary (Opening Round) #
############################

In the opening round of combat, have Ryu cast G.Drgn (with full AP), Bow and
Rand attack, and Bleu cast Bolt X.  After inflicting about 1300 damage points
to Barubary, the battle will end.

Barubary will then ask Ryu if he is willing enough to challenge him by
himself.  Do not challenge Barubary as Ryu alone if you don't have any WiseBLs,
since they are the most critical item at this point in the game in terms of
AP restoration for his Dragon powers.  You should also have some Extracts or
other HP restoring items, most notably Biscuits.

It is recommended that you fight Barubary with all your party members.  If
you manage to defeat him as Ryu only, Barubary will praise you with much
respect and tell you the location of a secret treasure chest (which you can
get without beating him as Ryu).  If you defeat him with your party, Barubary
will simply give a speech about how your strength will not be able to take
down Deathevn.

#######################
# Boss Battle 36 B    #
# Barubary (Ryu only) #
#######################

The game is kind enough to reward Ryu back to full HP and AP.  Have Ryu
immediately open up with G.Drgn to inflict 999 damage points to Barubary.  On
his next turn, Ryu should use a WiseBL to restore his AP.  Repeat the process
by casting G.Drgn once more.  If at any time Ryu's HP falls below 150, use an
Extract or whatever curative items you may have (Biscuits are last resorts).  
After Ryu casts G.Drgn four times, Barubary will be terminated.

#######################################
# Boss Battle 36 C                    #
# Barubary (Full Party--Recommended!) #
#######################################

Since Ryu's AP will be 0 when you restart against Barubary, have him attack
with the EmpireSD.  Bow should cast Cure 3 or X on the party, Rand should use a
WiseBL on Ryu, and Bleu should cast Bolt X.  The next turn should have Ryu
casting G.Drgn, Bow casting Cure 3 or X, and Rand and Bleu doing what they did
in their previous turn.  The timing of Ryu and Rand is critical in this
battle.  Ryu should cast G.Drgn and Rand should use a WiseBL after he casts
it.  This is so that in the very next turn, Ryu will have full AP to cast
G.Drgn once more.  Repeat the process until Barubary goes down.  Barubary's
fire/ice breath and other attacks usually do about 100 points of damage to
each party member, but a good dose of Cure 3 should be more than enough to
restore your party's HP.  Rand should be your back-up curer, so if your party
is getting slaughtered, consider having Rand and Bow cure, and Bleu using
WiseBLs on Ryu.

After defeating Barubary, head north through the rest of the pitch-black
room.  In the next room, use the Dragon Shrine and change your party members
so that Katt and Sten are in your party if they aren't already.  Now is the
time to obtain the secret treasure chest Barubary was talking about
(regardless if you beat him as Ryu only or not).

Head back into the pitch-black room and walk a couple steps south (three steps
south from where you are starting from in the room).  Face the right side and
put Katt in the lead of your marching order if she isn't already.  Activate her
special power by pressing the Y BUTTON on the Controller to whack an invisible
object obstruction your path.  Continue east after Katt whacks it away.  Head
south when you can't go east anymore, then east when you can't go south
anymore.

When you can't go east anymore, put Sten in the lead of the marching order
and have him activate his special power by pressing the Y BUTTON on the
Controller to reach to the invisible stake on the other side.  Now you are
able to obtain the treasure chest Barubary was talking about; in it lies the
LifeBR, a helpful "Etc." item that will prevent you from dying by the Death
spell.  Make sure Ryu or your most important character immediately equips
this, as you will find it helpful in the battle against Deathevn.

Go back to the room north of the pitch-black room, save using the Dragon
Shrine, and drink from the clear water.  Step on the orb in the eastern part
of the room to be teleported to a different room.

In this large, open, room, there are a number of doorways on each side of the
wall (excluding the north side).  These doorways lead to each other, and in
one case, take you further back into Infinity.  There is one doorway you need
to enter, and that is the one north of the orb you teleported from.  First,
though, you should get the treasure chest southwest of the orb for the KingHT.
Enter the northern doorway when you're ready.  It is recommended that your
characters be in their mid to late LV 40s to early 50s, at least.

As you proceed up in the final room of Infinity, you will be greeted by the
St. Eva God, himself, Evan.  He will call Ryu a "Nikanoru," a word used to
name someone who is a dead being.  Evan, abruptly, crystallizes the entire
party, supposedly killing them.  Then Ryu breaks out of the crystal,
shattering it to pieces.  Evan gets extremely upset and decides to shatter
each of your three crystallized party members, killing them.  Evan then gives
his speech about how Ryu will always be weaker than him, the power of "God."

Ryu is now paralyzed thanks to Evan.  To break the paralysis, press any
direction on the CONTROL PAD (up, down, left, or right) rapidly.  Ryu will
break free, and you will have control of him.  Head up and approach Evan.  
Something will burst inside Ryu (out of outrage for his fallen friends), and
a neat animation of him running across the floor will take place.  Ryu then
unsheathes his sword and rips Evan apart.  Evan falls into the abyss and an
earthquake occurs.  Then, the Demon God himself, Deathevn emerges.

#####################
# FINAL Boss Battle #
# Deathevn          #
#####################

Have Ryu immediately open up by casting Anfini, which will finally not be
grayed out in this battle against Deathevn.  After Ryu casts it, the scenery
changes while Ryu remembers his friends.  Your party members that were killed
by Evan are brought back to life and you are returned to the fight.

Note:  if you do not cast Anfini, you will n-e-v-er be able to defeat Deathevn.

With your party back, defeating Deathevn now seems plausible.  Have Ryu cast
G.Drgn, Bow cast Cure 3, Rand use a WiseBL on Ryu, and Bleu cast Bolt X.  
Deathevn uses a multitude of attack and death spells.  The death spells will
be a thorn at your side.  If at any time in the battle, one of your
characters gets killed, sacrifice your party's turn to bring them back to
life.  Do not neglect characters who are dead or it could come back to haunt
you.  Keep your party alive with LifePls and Renew X.  At some point in the
battle, your characters (other than Ryu) will probably be out of AP.  Use
Biscuits to restore your HP, which should last you for the rest of the
battle.  Keep attacking Deathevn with strong powerful attacks to inflict a
couple hundred of damage points.  In time, he will be defeated.

After defeating Deathevn, he will ask why you are so persistent in your
efforts to save the world.  He will disappear, not completely dead, and the
ending of Breath of Fire II will follow.

Congratulations on finishing Breath of Fire II!

                                  O---------O
                                  | Endings |
                                  O---------O

Breath of Fire II features three endings that you can view at some point in
the game.  This section will describe how to obtain the ending, and what the
ending is about.  Heavy spoilers abound!

Worst Ending
============
To view the worst ending, go through the game until after beating Habaruku in
battle at BushLnd (in the town of Gate).  Following the walkthrough, this
would be Section 119.

After defeating Habaruku, he gives a farewell speech about how there will be
a day when the Demon God will show himself to the world, and that the world
will truly suffer.  The Dragon tells you that Habaruku is merely being
controlled by the Demon, and that the Demon can no longer receive energy from
St. Eva since all of its founders are now officially dead.

The Dragon then asks Ryu an extremely important question:  should he allow
the Dragon to continue protecting the seal, hoping that the Demon won't be
able to show itself and break the seal, or does he want to confront the Demon
now and defeat it.  If you choose to "Wait," and reinforce your decision by
answering "Yes" again, you will get the worst ending in Breath of Fire II.

The ending will tell you that the Demon became too strong for even Ryu to
challenge, and that the world's history will be frozen forever, which sounds
quite chilling when you see the picture of the Demon God (Deathevn) and all
of his minions.

Sad Ending
==========
To view the sad ending, complete the game without making TownShip fly.  To
do this, make sure you either kill Ganer--Ryu's father--in the battle in St.
Eva Church (with the three Guardeyes), or don't bring Eichichi (located in
Guntz) to the well in TownShip.

After Deathevn has been defeated, Ryu has a strong urge to see all of his
friends again, and toast to the victory over the Demon God with them.  When
you have control of your party, head south and exit the last room of
Infinity.  The last character of your current party will stand by and say
his/her last words before leaving.

You head back to Dologany and are greeted by the Elder, Martin, and Wise Man
of the Dragon.  The scene switches back to TownShip, showing the characters
you didn't bring with you waiting for your return.  The party eventually
makes it out of Infinity and returns to Bush Land.  Ryu's friends compliment
him on how great he is.  As the party leaves BushLnd, something bothers
Ryu.  He then has a flashback, which occurred when they went to Dologany after
defeating Deathevn.

In it, he remembers what the Wise Man of the Dragon told him.  He told Ryu to
go off with his friends, but to "fulfill your destiny," meaning to protect the
world from the Demon God.  Ryu then flashbacks to what Deathevn said before he
disappeared.  Deathevn has not been killed completely and is fast asleep, so
Ryu senses that his mission hasn't been completed just yet.  Ryu feels that
there is still work that needs to be done.  The party realizes that Ryu hasn't
come back yet and decide to go back after him.  What follows next is a dragon's
screech...

The party goes back to the entrance of Infinity to find a new dragon
protecting the world:  Ryu.  They are deeply saddened by what has just
happened.  They try talking to Ryu, but Ryu does not answer for he is fast
asleep.  Ryu changed himself into a dragon to make sure that Deathevn will
never be able to escape from the underworld.  He made this sacrifice because
the dragon in his heart told him it was what he had to do.

The credits roll.  The credits showcase the people of Breath of Fire II (not
the people who actually developed the game), which is rather neat since you
get to see every character's full name (including last names).  Character
graphics are shown, in-between, and at the end, a picture of Valerie, Ryu,
and Yua is shown in a Dragon Tear.  If you wait a while, the world will begin
to scroll inside the Dragon Tear.

Best Ending
===========
To view the best ending, simply complete the game after making TownShip fly.  
To make TownShip fly, you must bring a person named Eichichi to the well in
TownShip (found in a secret room in Guntz--refer to Section 88 of the
walkthrough for detailed instructions on finding her).  You must also keep
Ganer--Ryu's father--alive by not killing him in the battle in St. Eva Church
featuring the three Guardeyes.  Defeat the Guardeyes by having Ryu cast his
weak Dragon Puppy spells, which only affect one target.  If you fulfill these
two requirements, you are guaranteed the best ending.

The ending plays out the same way as the Sad Ending except that Ryu does not
change into a dragon.  After they escape Infinity, suddenly, TownShip hovers
above Bush Land, and falls down over the entrances to Infinity, blocking them
completely.  Eichichi and Ganer refuse to let Ryu give himself up in order to
protect the world.  Ganer asks that Ryu go out into the world while he protects
the place.  He tells Ryu to spread the joy of harmony so Deathevn will never be
able to wake up.  Your friends welcome you back home, for good, and the credits
roll the same way as in the Sad Ending.

                                  O---------O
                                  | Shamans |
                                  O---------O

There are six shamans in the world of Breath of Fire II:  Sana, Water, Wind,
Earth, Holy, and Devil.  Here is where each is located.  This is also listed in
the exact order you will be able to get the shamans.

Fire Shaman:   Get Sana and Granny a new home (TownShip) and have a carpenter
build your town.  Sana, the Fire Shaman, will be available to
you to unite with.

Water Shaman:  Get her in the Witch Tower (north of SimaFort); after defeating
Nimufu, head all the way back to the room where there were five
platforms you could step on, and enter the left passageway this
time.  Continue, and you'll find a woman (if you tried going
here before, she was actually a statue) who'll tell you she's a
Water Shaman named "Seso."  Seso will tell you she will head to
TownShip and wait for you.

Wind Shaman:   Get Spoor in the Sky Tower; get to the top of the tower and
you'll be in a 'breathing room.'  Talk to the girl wandering
around on the center platform of this room.  "Spoor" tells you
that she's sorry for blowing fog; you learn she only did it
because she was bored.  You then learn that Spoor is the Wind
Shaman.  She then decides to go back to Granny in TownShip.

Earth Shaman:  Getting Solo is a little complicated.  You must donate 2000
coins (twenty 100 coin donations) in Namanda, but before the
fall of Evrai.  After you've donated, go through the game up
until when you revisit Gate for the 'grand finale,' and check
back in Farm Town.  In Farm Town, head through Daisy's house and
step onto the plowing field.  Solo should be standing there, so
talk to her and she'll gladly warp back to TownShip and stay
with Granny until you need her.

               (Note on getting the Earth Shaman:  contrary to popular belief,
               you can have any of your party members cast magic in the plowing
               field outside Daisy's house when battling the enemies, and the
               Earth Shaman will still join you.  This rumor that you cannot
               cast magic is false; the only prerequisite is to donate 2000
               coins in Namanda before Evrai's fall.)

Holy Shaman:   Get Seny in Bando; enter the church and continue north into the
secret passageway beneath the statue.  You'll then be in a
dungeon.  From the stairway, head north and enter the next
stairway going down.  On this next floor, enter the doorway to
your right, and you'll find the Holy Shaman, "Seny."  Talk to
her and she'll reluctantly head back to Granny so you can unite
with her.

Devil Shaman:  Get Shin inside Infinity; when you head back to Gate towards the
end of the game (after the villagers bomb the Dragon and the
demons rush outside), enter the left opening of Bush Land.
Remember the doors that were sealed before the bombing?  Well,
now that they are open you can enter them.  So enter the left
door (the right door leads you to the left door, and vice versa,
so it doesn't actually matter which door you enter), and you'll
find the "Devil Shaman" walking about.  Talk to her, and she'll
introduce herself as "Shin," and head to Granny's.

The following is a complete listing of every possible shaman and character
combination.  An "*" next to a character's name means this is one of their
best shaman combinations, or what Granny would say, a "great success."

Character     Shaman(s)         Bonuses                            Appearance

This is an ongoing list of miscellaneous hints that haven't been integrated
in the walkthrough.

1:  If you get Martin in House 5 of Township, and he asks you to give him 3000
coins, say no. Leave for a while and come back later and talk to him again.
He'll feel bad about trying to trick you, and will give you 5000 coins.

2:  Did you know that there's yet another Breath of Fire I character who makes
his way into Breath of Fire II?  It's Gobi.  If you are fishing in certain
spots, like around SimaFort, you will notice Gobi.
