# Walkthrough doc

## What's this about?

Well, i recently learned about [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Which looked very
exciting to me. Because i am very, very, very bad at designing i try to look
for something interesting to imitate. Meanwhile i had some trouble on Breath of
Fire II for the SNES and... yeah! I got to admit, i searched for some
walkthrough.

I always liked the style of those walkthroughs. Plain text, beautyful ASCII
art and just straight forward. But i seriously hate to navigate on those if all
i use to read is a tablet. So i just thought, would be nice enough if the toc
was linked to the content. And so it started.

And not to forget... Some nostalgia, because... By converting gamefaqs to HTML
i started learning it and got hooked. :)
